Mark A. Donovan discusses how a genre defined by its complex mechanics as much as by its social component can make the transition to Virtual Reality.</p><p>by <a href="http://twitter.com/MarklarDonovan ">Mark A. Donovan</a>, January 26 2016.</p><p>The world of virtual reality is in it's infancy. 2016 will see the VR marketplace open for business in a big way, with multiple consumer headsets in the offing and billions of dollars in investment, VR is shaping up to be one of the next decade's most impactful technology trends. The consumer version of the Oculus Rift is due to ship starting this March. The similarly capable HTC Vive in April. The Playstation VR sometime thereafter. </p><p>So with all the excitement of this I have recently acquired an older Oculus Dk2 model, and have begun my first foray into the Virtual space. As a longtime gamer, I have enjoyed the various experiences currently available for the Rift DK2, from a demo where I found myself sat in a clutch of eggs in a prehistoric time, being lurked over by a screaming T-Rex, or  when I was captaining my own ship and running trade routes in Elite Dangerous. Both struck me as amazingly surreal experiences to say the least. </p><p>It's already apparent to me that Virtual Reality holds a lot more promise than just gaming, with  productivity applications, movies, education and even medical applications representing just a fraction of what's possible. However gamers are arguably in the best position to populate and push the early stages of VR, for a number of reasons, chief among which is that gamers are legion: their numbers alone almost guarantee a loyal user base for early VR. </p><p>Almost immediately after taking off my Rift, and over a fresh cup of coffee, I began mulling over where Virtual Reality could best serve its throng of early enthusiasts. What games are the most suitable for a transition to VR? And which of those games already have sufficiently high adoption, with a built-in loyal fan base, to in turn help maximise VR adoption? </p><p>The conclusion that I settled on was, somewhat un-intuitively perhaps, MMORPG's. Provided capable developers could both devise and master the new rules of VR as applicable to this genre, we could see the advent of VR MMO's as a key factor in the adoption of VR as a whole. As a longtime MMO player, I have had some great times in multiple titles over the years, from high level raids with a big guild to being a solo PVE player enjoying the game in a more solitary way. </p><p>A VRMMO may have to adhere to new rules however. In order for an MMO to work in VR, it will have to be designed for that medium and that medium alone. Even the most basic, run of the mill MMO control mechanics, often requiring heavy use of the keyboard, will for example need to be rethought in a VR medium where the physical keyboard is hidden from the user. So what would a VRMMORPG potentially look like? Here are the key factors I believe are needed to bring a viable MMO experience to VR. </p><p><b>Controls: </b></p><p>Firstly, developers will have to reconsider controls from the ground up. The HTC Vive, Playstation and Oculus will have motion controllers which aim to provide virtual representations of the user's hands. The VRMMO, whose key interactions are currently dominated by UI abstractions and keyboard shortcuts, may need to look to more physical interaction metaphors such as gripping and pointing. In some situations, shifting from the traditional top-down and third person perspectives to a first person view could allow the player to cast spells or wield weapons in a more natural manner. In some cases, actual physical dexterity could be weighed against the classic dice roll to decide the success of a strike.</p><p><b>Perspective:</b></p><p>When it comes to perspective, caution will have to be applied to how the game camera, and therefore the player's viewpoint, is treated. A greater emphasis on first person perspectives may be appropriate, although games like Oculus' own Lucky's Tale have shown that "birds's eye" views can work well in VR, suggesting that games like League Of legends, featuring an isometric viewpoint, may work equally well. </p><p><b>Scale:</b></p><p>Depending on how perspective is treated, it will be vital that the scaling of the game world  feel real and correct at all times, both in a bird's eye view as well as in close encounters. The scale of objects and players in the world will also have to be managed with a mind to both minimise the effects of VR headsets' relatively low resolutions (text and small objects do not fare well), and to be cognizant of the pros and cons of stereoscopic displays (large, distant landscapes can look flat in VR). </p><p><b>Combat/Movement: </b></p><p>I am no developer, and the intricate workings of combat mechanics are like upside down long division to me. That said, I realise that the elation i get, in a normal MMO, from flipping my character twenty feet in the air to then slice down on the head of the big boss may not translate well to VR. In  first person perspective, that same maneuver is more likely to have the player reaching for the nearest bucket. That doesn't mean that the VRMMO is handicapped in this regard, but it does highlight the need for it to be designed with these constraints in mind to ensure that players can actually stay in the game unimpeded. </p><p><b>Social: </b></p><p>This, in my opinion is where the VRMMO shines the brightest. After frequenting some of the currently available social applications such as Altspace VR, and the brilliant user-generated VR-Chat, I can say with confidence that the social aspect of a VRMMO would be astounding. Upon my first visit to VR-Chat, for example, I suddenly found myself having three hour discussion sat around a table with four people. Even from their simple avatars, I could make out their mannerisms, infer a little of their personalities. That, more than anything in the virtual world, made the experience feel real. </p><p>Based on this experience, I can see a whole new level of player interaction based not just on the narrative of a game's plot, but on questing and raiding mechanics designed with a much stronger than ever focus on promoting social interaction and player collaboration. </p><p>I do believe a VRMMO is inevitable. It will be interesting to see how different developers interpret these new challenges (and opportunities) to the long-standing long traditions inherent in MMO mechanics. With some luck, and a lot of hard work, us players may end up with our biggest reason to keep putting on those VR headsets: an immersive virtual experience where it's the other humans who make it feel real.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="59"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="61"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="62"><span data-reactid="63"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="64"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="65"/></a><h2 data-reactid="66"><a data-reactid="67">Guest Post: An MMO for VR</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="69"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="70"><div class="Link" data-reactid="71"><a data-reactid="72">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="73"></div></section></div></div>
