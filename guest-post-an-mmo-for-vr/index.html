In some cases, actual physical dexterity could be weighed against the classic dice roll to decide the success of a strike.","length":708,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16,"measurementHash":"5ab63c1122c16c1d439f3a19efb355be"},{"id":"68319854-ba72-49b4-9762-66231a3862f2","item":"8abbc554-0930-4caa-9edf-f650a19f1040","type":"text","html":"<p><b>Perspective:</b></p>","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"keywords":[],"description":"","datePublished":null,"dateModified":null,"user":"d9e6efde-0d98-46dc-a8eb-5662c2edc260","source":"8abbc554-0930-4caa-9edf-f650a19f1040","authors":[],"publisher":{"name":null,"domain":null,"url":null,"favicon":null}},"src":null,"text":"Perspective:","length":12,"language":"en","measurementVersion":16,"measurementHash":"9e598cedee7b805184e245728781ed1e"},{"id":"fe3bc655-e453-4633-91f4-138d7eb26a98","item":"8abbc554-0930-4caa-9edf-f650a19f1040","type":"text","html":"<p>When it comes to perspective, caution will have to be applied to how the game camera, and therefore the player's viewpoint, is treated.
