You don&#x27;t duck fast enough. You experience your head roll to the ground just before your world fades to black. The level reloads. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="43"><p data-reactid="44">You&#x27;re not Indiana Jones, but you could be. The Virtual Reality experience you&#x27;ve been playing is an indie game in no way officially associated with LucasFilm, Disney, or the Indiana Jones franchise. It is simply a labour of love aiming to replicate the iconic temple challenges from the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It doesn&#x27;t use any of the movie&#x27;s character names, the locations are subtly different, but the scenario is unmistakeable: you&#x27;re three challenges away from the Holy Grail.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="45"><p data-reactid="46">Now, before you go hunting  for this amazing VR experience, let me save you some time. It does not exist. Yet. But the pace of consumer VR is accelerating rapidly, and the availability of increasingly user friendly content creation tools like Unity and Unreal Engine have put the creation of such scenarios within the reach of any dedicated fan with spare time and a minimum of technical know-how on their side.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="47"><p data-reactid="48">Replicating, or approximating, such iconic cinematic scenarios in a more traditional gaming medium has of course been done before (Here&#x27;s looking at you, Tomb Raider), but not until the advent of VR has there been such a compelling reason to try and replicate those iconic moments in their full interactive glory. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="49"><p data-reactid="50">But how close could a VR representation of an iconic movie scene need to be before it bordered on copyright infringement? Does the doctrine of Fair Use apply to recognisable situations? Can you conceivably copyright a location or scenery? And how could you even enforce any such claims when the mere presence of player interaction, and therefore agency, guarantee that the scene itself will never play out exactly the same way twice?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="51"><p data-reactid="52">These are all questions that will become more important as the Virtual Reality revolution continues to change the way we experience media. Even today, fan-driven replications of iconic settings inspired by classic movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars are starting to emerge. None of these fan-generated experiences have thus far been challenged by the letter of the law, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="53"><p data-reactid="54">The difficulty will lie in defining what specifically defines an iconic set piece like the Holy Grail challenges, particularly in those instances that lack specific dialog (which is eminently protected by copyright). Any one scene  in cinema can in fact be roughly broken down to the following components:</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="55"><p data-reactid="56">So can any combination of of these parts be considered an artifact that could run afoul of copyright law? In  an interactive VR experience, any or all of these could be perfectly replicated to various degrees, with the possible exceptions may include Choreography and Duration, in the case of experiences where the player takes on the role of protagonist and is given agency to operate freely (and unpredictably) within the confines of the experience&#x27;s environment and mechanics.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="57"><p data-reactid="58"></p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="59"><p data-reactid="60">In practice this might mean that, while you could get away with recreating the inside of the Nostromo room for room, you may be in trouble if you included the Wayland-Yutani Corporation logo anywhere it can be seen, or a perfect virtual likeness of Ripley chilling by the mess table.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="61"><p data-reactid="62">Much of this is, of course, speculation. The truth is that this precise situation has simply not come up before, so it may be that no applicable precedents exist. Is producing a VR experience carefully recreating the Saw puzzles the same thing as building an unlicensed theme park, or is it fair game so long as Billy the Puppet stays out of it? </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="63"><p data-reactid="64">We&#x27;ll find out soon enough, as both Virtual Reality and its available content continue to mature. But it&#x27;s not too early to start considering the potential of immersing players inside their favourite fantasy set pieces - and the consequences of failing to strike a balance between respecting intellectual property and not stifling creative freedom. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="65"><p data-reactid="66">Thoughts?

Luckey</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 163 --><!-- react-empty: 164 --><!-- react-empty: 165 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="166"><p data-reactid="167">From Rift production issues to the future of the Oculus Store, here are some key highlights from yesterday&#x27;s Reddit AMA. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="168"><p data-reactid="169">On the Rift&#x27;s production:  reaffirming his previously stated surprise at the amount of demand for the Rift&#x27;s preorders, Palmer confirmed that Oculus is in the process of scaling up production to meet the unexpected demand. It is unlikely however this will significantly affect shipping estimates, with new preorders for the Rift currently estimated for a June shipping timeframe.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="170"><p data-reactid="171">On the Oculus Store: Palmer tried to allay fears of a split in the VR market as a result of exclusive storefronts for VR content. According to him the Oculus Store,  Oculus&#x27;s upcoming curated marketplace for VR content, will not be exclusive to Rift titles and instead accept content that is also compatible with third party VR solutions like the HTC Vive. We&#x27;d previously written about the potential for VR to escape the exclusivity trap that has ensnared multiple generations of consoles, and this is a very positive development at such an early stage for the VR industry. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="172"><p data-reactid="173">Other details on the Oculus store either confirmed or announced by Palmer included the fact that the store will feature interactive, 360º 3D screenshots from inside featured VR experiences, as well as a comfort rating system to help users make more informed decisions as to the content they download. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="174"><p data-reactid="175">On censorship: Palmer was asked about Oculus&#x27;s position towards content censorship, with a particular focus on adult content for the Rift. He restated Oculus&#x27;s position that, while the Oculus Store will not be featuring adult content, Oculus will do nothing to block such content from third party sources. This will certainly come as welcome news to the burgeoning adult VR industry, which is (somewhat typically) already one of the first to be actively profiting from VR even before wide consumer adoption.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="176"><p data-reactid="177">On launch content: it had already been widely reported that the Oculus launch titles would include Eve: Valkyrie and Lucky&#x27;s Tale, as well as the VR movie experience Henry and another unannounced title from Oculus Studios. Yesterday Palmer also confirmed that the popular Oculus Cinema app for GearVR, which allows standard video content to be experienced in a virtual cinema, will be available for the Rift at launch. Palmer also confirmed that the Rift will come with a &quot;Demo experience&quot; showcasing multiple types of VR experiences in one demonstration reel.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="178"><p data-reactid="179">The first Oculus Rift headsets are due to reach consumer hands shortly after initial shipping on March 28th. We can expect Oculus to make further announcements about launch content and Oculus touch availability between now and then. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="180"><p
