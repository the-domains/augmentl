poised to lead the way. Could this be the "gateway drug" to mass-market VR adoption?</p><p>by <a href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">Augmentl</a>, February 8th, 2016</p><p>I don't normally find myself talking to random strangers. Much less random strangers who present themselves as floating robot heads, flying bee drones, and cartoon avatars. </p><p>Yet, this weekend I found myself  doing just that as I spent several hours in <a href="http://altvr.com/">AltSpaceVR</a>, arguably one of the most polished among the initial batch of emerging social VR platforms making their way to VR headsets from the Rift to the GearVR. </p><p>Since its founding in 2013, AltSpaceVR has become a platform where users can meet, talk, and play within a limited number of "worlds." IT further adds the ability for developers to create and share small applications within these worlds ranging from tabletop games (including full <a href="https://account.altvr.com/pages/landing/dnd">Dungeons and Dragons</a> tournaments) to Air Hockey tables, to MineCraft like building blocks or anything in between. AltSpace's collaborative spaces and shared screens also facilitate the sharing of video and web pages by anyone in the world, in  a sort of unmoderated, democratic "let's all take turns" way.</p><p>But as slick the technology may be, the key ingredient to the experience is the people who choose to inhabit it. Until recently however, AltSpaceVR's user base was mainly limited to developers and enthusiasts with access to a PC based VR headset like the Rift or Vive developer kits. As a result, AltSpaceVR's world often felt empty outside of its occasionally scheduled special events, which tended to attract larger crowds.</p><p>That all changed last week when, after a lengthy Alpha test phase, GearVR users at large were finally able to enter the AltSpaceVR experience directly through their mobile VR headset.  Suddenly, the world was filled with people new to the social VR space, many new to VR itself, wondering around and sharing their experience.</p><p>Being present at the moment of influx of first-time users to a VR platform can be quite enlightening. As I (or rather, my avatar) stood in the Welcome Space, I was engaged by a number of of users just coming up to say hello, many of which were still trying to figure out how to navigate the world. They commented in amazement at my virtual hands as I waved at them (I have a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/product/vr">Leap Motion</a> strapped to my Rift DK2), and by way of breaking the ice asked what VR hardware everyone was running.</p><p>After a few hours and many such conversations, I learned that many of these users were generally unfamiliar with VR beyond the GearVR itself, making vague allusions to the "HTC one" (Referring to the HTC Vive), or the Crescent Bay (Referring to the upcoming Oculus Rift) when talking about other VR platforms. For many more, mobile VR was their only affordable option into the space for the foreseeable future. Several more still would have loved the option of "full-fledged" VR but were unsure about whether their PC's would be able to support it (mostly, they would not).</p><p>These conversations not only demonstrated the power of the mobile VR as an effective mass-market entry point to Virtual Reality, but may also have provided a hint as to just how long the road ahead might be in terms of communicating to the public what VR can truly offer. While the industry press (ourselves included)  busies itself with dissecting the pros and cons of the Rift versus the Vive, the average consumer still has only a vague notion of the Virtual Reality landscape, mainly defined by their access to, or awareness of, mobile VR.</p><p>And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Mobile VR may be as good an introduction to Virtual Reality as mobile gaming is to console and PC gaming, provided the right experiences take centre stage. Mobile VR may in fact facilitate the influx of new potential consumers into a market that would otherwise be relegated to the enthusiast arena. In an evolutionary path that effectively reverses that of video games (a traditionally expensive hobby that became cheaper and more widespread with the advent of mobile), VR may actually find its first mass audience at the low end, with compelling applications like social hopefully serving as gateways to the high end. </p><p>The good news is that social VR does not need high-end PC's to be effective. When the key part of the experience is human in nature, there's no real need for photorealistic graphics and complex game mechanics. Simple, emotively evocative avatars and basic collaborative mechanics can in fact be just as effective at mediating a Virtual Reality social experience. And contrary to much of the mobile VR content available today, social VR has an intrinsic stickiness that may hold it above the level of ephemeral novelty long enough for users to be fully "sold" on the VR promise. </p><p>So, as I stood under a virtual tree talking to a bunch of friendly robots, it struck me that the sort of intrinsically social experiences that platforms like AltSpaceVR facilitate may well play a fundamental role in helping VR establish a firm foothold in the market. Suddenly, Facebook's unprecedented $2bn gamble on the platform  made a lot more sense: to bring VR not just to enthusiasts waiting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>, but to just about everyone on the planet. </p></div></article></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="57"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="59"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="60"><span data-reactid="61"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="62"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="63"/></a><h2 data-reactid="64"><a data-reactid="65">Under the Virtual Tree: Social VR as a Gateway Experience</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="66"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="67"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="68"><div class="Link" data-reactid="69"><a data-reactid="70">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="71"></div></section></div></div>
