Headset Demonstrates One Point: AR is Hard.</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 74 --><!-- react-empty: 75 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="76"><p data-reactid="77">At first glance, the Meta 2 is an impressive realisation of our sci-fi dreams. But a closer look reveals a reality of tempered ambitions.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="78"><p data-reactid="79">The new Meta 2 headset is undoubtedly interesting. Like Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens and the ever secretive Magic Leap technology, the Meta 2 pulls off the difficult trick  of anchoring 3D digital content onto real-world environments. To the user, it provides a hologram-like experience. Unlike the HoloLens, however, the Meta 2 also lets its users manipulate these holograms with their bare hands, letting them twist, pick up, slap and poke these digital artefacts as one would a physical object.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="80"><p data-reactid="81">Or, at least, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s trying to do. In actual fact, the anchoring is jittery - the digital content&#x27;s connection to the physical world can appear twitchy and unsteady as the user moves and looks around. Picking up and interacting with digital objects also kind-of-works, providing the sort of semi-reliable, unsteady interaction that&#x27;s more remindful of the old, pre-Orion Leap Motion implementation than the level of precision achievable with the Oculus Touch or HTC Vive&#x27;s motion controllers.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="82"><p data-reactid="83">The Meta 2 might have been more impressive one or two years back, before HoloLens gave us a tantalising glimpse of what an untethered AR device could (and could not) achieve. But today, the Meta 2 stands out as an awkward, if perhaps pragmatic, compromise - an admission of defeat in the face of technology challenges that are still far from being resolved. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="84"><p data-reactid="85">At $949, the Meta 2 does  give developers interested in tinkering with the opportunities of AR a competitive entry point against the $3000 HoloLens, but it&#x27;s unlikely to appeal to a broad audience. And that&#x27;s ok. AR is today where VR was three years ago, when the Oculus Rift DK1 was the best VR experience a mere mortal could get their hands on.

In HTC's own words, the consumer Vive is effectively a rebrand of the Pre with minor changes:</p><p>The Vive's $799 US price is unlikely to generate the same outrage as the Rift's $599 price reveal, due in large part to the latter's priming of the market and HTC's past positioning of the Vive as a <i>"premium VR experience."</i> The pricing also gives Oculus a $150-$200 price range for their upcoming Touch motion controllers, if they wish to remain price competitive with the Vive bundle. </p><p>With both the Rift and the HTC Vive prices being in line with each other, the biggest decision consumers now have to make will be based on content, and on whether they are prepared to wait until the Touch release in order to enjoy motion controllers in their VR experiences.</p></div><div

AltSpace&#x27;s collaborative spaces and shared screens also facilitate the sharing of video and web pages by anyone in the world, in  a sort of unmoderated, democratic &quot;let&#x27;s all take turns&quot; way.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="357"><p data-reactid="358">Being present at the moment of influx of first-time users to a VR platform can be quite enlightening. As I (or rather, my avatar) stood in the Welcome Space, I was engaged by a number of of users just coming up to say hello, many of which were still trying to figure out how to navigate the world. They commented in amazement at my virtual hands as I waved at them (I have a Leap Motion strapped to my Rift DK2), and by way of breaking the ice asked what VR hardware everyone was running.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="359"><p data-reactid="360">After a few hours and many such conversations, I learned that many of these users were generally unfamiliar with VR beyond the GearVR itself, making vague allusions to the &quot;HTC one&quot; (Referring to the HTC Vive), or the Crescent Bay (Referring to the upcoming Oculus Rift) when talking about other VR platforms. For many more, mobile VR was their only affordable option into the space for the foreseeable future. Several more still would have loved the option of &quot;full-fledged&quot; VR but were unsure about whether their PC&#x27;s would be able to support it (mostly, they would not).</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="361"><p data-reactid="362">These conversations not only demonstrated the power of the mobile VR as an effective mass-market entry point to Virtual Reality, but may also have provided a hint as to just how long the road ahead might be in terms of communicating to the public what VR can truly offer. While the industry press (ourselves included)  busies itself with dissecting the pros and cons of the Rift versus the Vive, the average consumer still has only a vague notion of the Virtual Reality landscape, mainly defined by their access to, or awareness of, mobile VR.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="363"><p data-reactid="364">And that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. Mobile VR may be as good an introduction to Virtual Reality as mobile gaming is to console and PC gaming, provided the right experiences take centre stage. Mobile VR may in fact facilitate the influx of new potential consumers into a market that would otherwise be relegated to the enthusiast arena. In an evolutionary path that effectively reverses that of video games (a traditionally expensive hobby that became cheaper and more widespread with the advent of mobile), VR may actually find its first mass audience at the low end, with compelling applications like social hopefully serving as gateways to the high end. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="365"><p data-reactid="366">The good news is that social VR does not need high-end PC&#x27;s to be effective. When the key part of the experience is human in nature, there&#x27;s no real need for photorealistic graphics and complex game mechanics. Simple, emotively evocative avatars and basic collaborative mechanics can in fact be just as effective at mediating a Virtual Reality social experience. And contrary to much of the mobile VR content available today, social VR has an intrinsic stickiness that may hold it above the level of ephemeral novelty long enough for users to be fully &quot;sold&quot; on the VR promise. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="367"><p data-reactid="368">So, as I stood under a virtual tree talking to a bunch of friendly robots, it struck me that the sort of intrinsically social experiences that platforms like AltSpaceVR facilitate may well play a fundamental role in helping VR establish a firm foothold in the market. Suddenly, Facebook&#x27;s unprecedented $2bn gamble on the platform  made a lot more sense: to bring VR not just to enthusiasts waiting for the Metaverse, but to just about everyone on the planet. </p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="14" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-13vw p-v-4 color-bg  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="369"><span style="font-size:0;" data-reactid="370"></span><div class="Component p-1 color-title color-text " data-reactid="371"><p data-reactid="372">loading ...</p></div></section></div><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="373"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="374"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="375"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="376"><span data-reactid="377"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="378"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="379"/></a><h2 data-reactid="380"><a data-reactid="381">ɅUGMΞNTL.IO</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="382"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="383"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="384"><div class="Link" data-reactid="385"><a data-reactid="386"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="387"><a data-reactid="388">ɅUGMΞNTL RSS</a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="389"><a data-reactid="390">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="391"></div></section></div></div>
