It also shifted the conversation away from what really matters.</p><p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/augmentl">Augmentl</a>, February 2nd 2016</p><p>Last month's introduction of the HTC Vive Pre at CES - HTC's second Virtual Reality developer kit - brought with it the addition of a front-facing camera, arguably one of the Vive's most unique selling points in addition to its novel Lighthouse tracking technology and a strong focus on so-called "room scale" experiences (VR experiences where players can walk around and interact freely with the Virtual world.).</p><p>Both <i>"room-scale"</i> and <i>"Chaperone"</i> (The camera's primary purpose, a safety feature notifying users of real-world obstacles) have garnered an enormous amount of press, and rightly so. They are new additions to the emerging field of consumer VR and bring new and exciting possibilities to an already excited and enthusiastic community.</p><p>Comparatively speaking, Oculus got a raw deal. While the undisputed founders of the VR revolution got their fair share of press following their CES announcements, most of it concerned the perceived high cost of their newly released consumer product. According to many, USD$600 was a steep price of entry for a VR headset that most expected to come in at the previous developer kits' ballpark price of USD$350.</p><blockquote><p>The Oculus Rift was no longer a culmination of years of iterative R&D and custom manufacturing: it was now "the one without the camera. The one without motion controllers."</p></blockquote><p>So, while Oculus was first to the punch with an actual, tangible consumer product, HTC got much of the love from both the industry press and more mainstream media outlets. The Rift was generally acknowledged as the more polished VR device, but the Vive Pre, with its camera and room-scale tracking out of the box, got most of the buzz. </p><p>But therein lies a problem: with so much press and community buzz being focused on the novelty of what the Vive brought to the table, the general public lost track of the biggest challenges facing VR's adoption. Suddenly the Oculus Rift was no longer a culmination of years of iterative R&D and custom manufacturing: it was now "the one without the camera. The one without motion controllers."</p><p>In one fell swoop, HTC managed to shift the conversation away from their lack of a finished product (to which, less than a month from official preorders, HTC has yet to commit), and towards making anything less than a camera-equipped, room-scale tracked VR solution look inferior. Whereas last year the VR community was discussing the importance of <i>"Presence,"</i> VR was suddenly all about <a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/valves-chet-faliszek-on-htc-vive-pre-content-showcase-surprises-and-ninja-cats/">not bumping into your cat</a> while you walk and interact around your room.</p><blockquote><p>What VR needs to deliver, if nothing else, is the ability to fool our brain into thinking VR is real. To deliver Presence.</p></blockquote><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/35aa9f7c-913a-49f7-94fc-1c442e9016ee.jpg"><p>The tech community and media alike have a short attention span. The new and shiny will always trump the established. And with VR moving at breakneck speed, this tendency is only exacerbated. So let's take an opportunity to go back to basics, to consider not what VR could possibly deliver as it evolves, but rather what VR <i>needs</i> to deliver <i>right now</i> in its first, most defining, and possibly make-or-break generation. </p><p>If it's to succeed, what VR needs to deliver right now, if nothing else, is the ability to fool our brain into accepting the virtual as real. To deliver <i>Presence</i>.</p><p>Presence is what Oculus VR has dedicated <a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-shares-5-key-ingredients-for-presence-in-virtual-reality/">their entire R&D effort towards</a>. It's why almost every component in the Rift is custom. It's the reason behind the Rift's $USD600 price point. Presence is, to the best of current technology's ability to deliver, the very essence of the Rift's design ethos.</p><p>And that's because achieving Presence is really, really hard. Our brain is very good at spotting fakery, and will go to great lengths to remind us that what we are seeing in VR is not real. Overcoming that primal characteristic of our very biology therefore demands striking a finely tuned balance, simultaneously fooling our perceptions of motion, imagery, and sound while removing incidental distractions that would rip us out of the virtual experience.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c72850e7-d41a-4a8f-bdc5-289bbab48c1d.jpg"><p>Presence is the reason the Rift is made of textile materials instead of cheaper plastics, and has the weight distribution of a baseball cap: to ensure the device feels weightless and stays put when we move, to avoid distractions and to help us forget we're wearing a device at all.  </p><p>Presence is the reason for Oculus to have spent resources on a finely calibrated, audiophile quality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAwFN9sFcso">integrated audio solution</a>: to fool our brain into thinking the sounds we hear in VR are sources, not recordings, as accurately positioned in the virtual world as they would be in the real one.</p><p>Presence is also the reason why Oculus opted for the best possible combination of custom optics and displays which, while being similar to those in the HTC Vive, do by most accounts have a slight edge in overall image clarity and in the removal of distracting screen-fill artefacts, commonly known as the Screen Door Effect.</p><p>Finally, Presence is the reason why Oculus has worked in close partnership with Microsoft, and GPU manufacturers nVidia and AMD, to ensure the fastest access to the underlying graphics hardware and to facilitate the implementation of Ansynchronous Time Warp, a difficult to pull off software level solution to ensure head movements in VR appear smooth at all times, masking any occasional game performance drops. </p><p>Yes, Oculus could have invested in a pass-through camera solution. They could also have pushed for their tracked motion controllers, the Oculus Touch, to be made available with the Rift at launch instead of later this year. But they didn't. Not because of lack of resources (Oculus is backed by over USD$2bn of Facebook funding), but because of a strong focus on delivering on the one, most fundamental promise of VR: Presence. </p><blockquote><p>Without Presence, there is no VR</p></blockquote><p>The HTC Vive is an impressive device. Together with its Lighthouse tracking and motion control solution, it's in fact an impressive <i>system</i>. It's an all-in-one, out-of-the-box solution to deliver VR at a physical scale of interaction greater than Oculus's, at least until the second half of the year where we will be able to properly evaluate Oculus's own motion control solution. </p><p>But what the Vive delivers in scale, it lacks in fundamentals. Its displays and optics are just a notch short of what can be achieved in this hardware generation. Its audio solution is generic and at the mercy of what each player's own headphones can deliver. Its ergonomics consist of a comparatively heavy plastic housing paired with elastic straps. </p><p>And while it's true that the Vive's freedom of room-scale movement and controller tracking is a powerful presence multiplier, any VR solution which doesn't first and foremost deliver on those fundamentals of presence is just <i>multiplying by zero</i>.</p><p>So while the Vive can absolutely deliver presence, it is likely to be more fleeting: a dropped frame, a slip of the headset, the weight on the nose, a too-faint or too-loud sound. In VR, any of these seemingly insignificant distractions are enough to break the fragile illusion of Presence, ejecting the player right back into the real world. </p><p>While any and all of these factors will also likely affect the Rift, they're going to be comparatively minimised by the very attention to the fundamentals of VR that has defined Oculus's path to market. Because without those fundamentals, there is no Presence. And without Presence, there is no VR.</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="31"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="33"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="34"><span data-reactid="35"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="36"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="37"/></a><h2 data-reactid="38"><a data-reactid="39">The Oculus Rift, Presence, Hype, and the Fundamentals of VR</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="42"><div class="Link" data-reactid="43"><a data-reactid="44">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="45"></div></section></div></div>
