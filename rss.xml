            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>HTC Denies Reports It Will Spin Its VR Business Into A Standalone Company</h1><p>Virtual reality is becoming a major focus for struggling smartphone maker HTC, but not so major that it will spin out its VR business into a standalone company. The firm today issued a statement denying a report from local media in its home country of Taiwan which claimed Chairwoman Cher Wang is in the process of creating a new VR entity that is wholly owned by her and HTC.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/896426d8bf1d0e249dc98f0b3fdd30ab6c23eb83.png"></article>]]></description>

An Oculus spokeswoman confirmed that the company has leased an office in Pittsburgh "that's dedicated to Oculus Research." In other words, it's not just for any employees of Facebook, and not just for any Oculus employees, either.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f1596a565709261ceab6563d5a294894e3dc7a19.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's Cardboard Isn't Really VR, But It's About to Get a Whole Lot Closer to the Real Thing</h1><p>For all there is to love about Google Cardboard, it's still a bare-bones experience. It's barely even VR, really. But the cheap, smartphone-based viewer offers the VR-curious an easy window into 360-degree video. Pricier headsets like the Oculus Rift and Sony PlayStation VR, designed for gaming, deliver more than a cool stereoscopic viewing experience.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c531296e0c85aa1ca8d1404c751f0513c55f7c32.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Preorders for the HTC Vive open February 29, But Can HTC Deliver by April?</h1><p>Aside from the price, the big question that remains concerning the Vive is whether HTC's promised April timeframe for shipping and wider consumer availability is realistic. While Oculus announced the start of production and manufacturing of their consumer product as far back as September 2015, HTC are yet to show a final, consumer ready version of their VR offering.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a5d98f421ee4a9f39dfd796a4d52ea856a041838.jpg"></article>]]></description>
