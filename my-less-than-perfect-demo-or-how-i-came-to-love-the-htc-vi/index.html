Less Than Perfect Demo. Or, How I Came To Love The HTC Vive.</h1><p>I was given the opportunity to take their HTC Vive for a spin. I was not impressed. At first. </p><p>By Augmentl (<a data-grid-id="5ce4c9f6-5006-4bf9-93e0-dc5e9ed7d9ba" href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">@augmentl</a>). November 21, 2015.</p><p>My chance to test the Vive came as part of the demo day organised by the excellent folks over at GameFace Labs, where I also had the opportunity to <a data-grid-id="e7ba1ea2-deba-4f82-b482-e55bbd8b4229" href="http://augmentl.io/hands-on-with-gameface-labs-latest-prototype/">play with their latest hardware</a>. The Vive was in some ways everything that it was supposed to be, but in other ways not what I was expecting. </p><p>The fault was not in the device itself, but rather in the insane amount of expectation and anticipation the generally glowing reviews of the hardware had instilled in me.  I had all the device's specs in my head, and was prepared to test each and every one of them in my limited 45 minute session. </p><p>So when I first got to strap on the Vive, and was put inside the Aperture Science demo, I instantly ran through a mental checklist of specifications: </p><p><i data-grid-id="d69f34d4-0328-4c4d-b2f8-78f7552c6f15">"Screen door effect? I can see it. Damn it. Wait no, I'm really focusing on the screen. Relax. OK it's gone. Theres a kind of a 
linen texture to the screen. Must be the diffuser. Not bad!"</i></p><p><i data-grid-id="0506967b-a21d-4331-89eb-58fc6ebb5c34">"OK. 
Field of View? Subjectively wider than the DK2. Maybe not as tall. Not bad, I can live with this!" </i></p><p><i data-grid-id="ec497cba-3e09-4b1e-b22b-7474dc5bb0bf">"IPD? It's off. I need to fiddle with it. OK I think I got it. No, wait... OK now I got it."</i></p><p>And so on. I just could not relax into just experiencing the moment. All my anticipation, the preconceived expectations, and all the technical specs rattling in my head were actively conspiring from actually being in the moment and just experiencing the damn thing.</p><p>Initially, I time-shifted between "testing" the device and figuring out what the demo wanted me to do. I needed to open a drawer, but Chaperone was telling me I was about to reach a wall. That's the Ed from GameFace, detecting my helpless floundering, helpfully tipped me off that I could "extend my reach" by pressing down on the controller's touchpad. Aha! OK now I could move on.</p><p>Then my left controller's trigger started acting up. Was it acting up or was I screwing up? At this point, the elusive holy grail of VR, <i data-grid-id="d3e15feb-b7c2-4020-b468-b459fa366adc">Presence</i>, was nowhere to be seen. Both myself and those tiny technical glitches were getting in the way.</p><p>But somewhere along the way, it happened. At some point between me failing to fix a broken robot and the floor opening up below me, I was <i data-grid-id="6ba401a0-1b1e-42be-a55d-8826769bd938">there</i>. My stupid brain finally bought into the illusion and I was gobsmacked. </p><p>After Aperture Science I was put through TiltBrush (I wish I had talent), The Gallery (Wish I knew what I was doing), and Job Simulator (Wish I could have stayed there for a few hours). All of which I enjoyed immensely. Others have done a much better job reviewing these experiences than I could, so I'll avoid doing that here.</p><p>As I reached the end of Job Simulator, I barely caught myself dropping the controllers onto a kitchen counter that was't there. I don't think me dropping the controllers on the floor would have endeared me to the GameFace team, but that almost-oops moment did confirm one thing for me: this thing is the real deal. And I want one. Now.</p><blockquote><p data-grid-id="2b5c6581-4d63-4965-8ff8-b5d6dad2fa33">It's a lot easier to experience Presence when your brain has nothing else to deal with.</p><p data-grid-id="def85251-b2b5-4110-8dc9-7cd87873e399"></p></blockquote><p>Something else I learned in this experience is how difficult it is to engineer a set of demos directly targeted presence in VR. 
In this I believe the Oculus team may have had an advantage last year. When I got to they the Crescent Bay prototype at 
the first Oculus Connect, my sense of presence was instant and total. But I believe that had as much to do with the 
experience being completely passive (I just had to hand there), than about any inherent qualities of the hardware I was 
testing. It's a lot easier to experience Presence when your brain has nothing else to deal with.</p><p>So to anyone getting the opportunity to demo new VR hardware, either at an event or at a lucky friend's place, here is my advice: take a breath, look around, and relax. Let it come to you.</p><p>And as far as the Vive goes, well... Shut up and take my money.</p><p><a data-grid-id="f0e23954-f1bd-4a77-8479-719a4112fd2e" href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">@augmentl</a></p></div></article></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="55"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="57"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="58"><span data-reactid="59"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="60"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="61"/></a><h2 data-reactid="62"><a data-reactid="63">My Less Than Perfect Demo.
