the Fundamentals of VR</h1><p>When the HTC Vive introduced the concepts of room-scale and Chaperone to the emerging VR marketplace, it introduced some welcome innovation to an enthusiastic public. It also shifted the conversation away from what really matters.</p><p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/augmentl">Augmentl</a>, February 2nd 2016</p><p>Last month's introduction of the HTC Vive Pre at CES - HTC's second Virtual Reality developer kit - brought with it the addition of a front-facing camera, arguably one of the Vive's most unique selling points in addition to its novel Lighthouse tracking technology and a strong focus on so-called "room scale" experiences (VR experiences where players can walk around and interact freely with the Virtual world.).</p><p>Both <i>"room-scale"</i> and <i>"Chaperone"</i> (The camera's primary purpose, a safety feature notifying users of real-world obstacles) have garnered an enormous amount of press, and rightly so. They are new additions to the emerging field of consumer VR and bring new and exciting possibilities to an already excited and enthusiastic community.</p><blockquote><p>The Oculus Rift was no longer a culmination of years of iterative R&D and custom manufacturing: it was now "the one without the camera. The one without motion controllers."</p></blockquote><p>But therein lies a problem: with so much press and community buzz being focused on the novelty of what the Vive brought to the table, the general public lost track of the biggest challenges facing VR's adoption. Suddenly the Oculus Rift was no longer a culmination of years of iterative R&D and custom manufacturing: it was now "the one without the camera. The one without motion controllers."</p><p>In one fell swoop, HTC managed to shift the conversation away from their lack of a finished product (to which, less than a month from official preorders, HTC has yet to commit), and towards making anything less than a camera-equipped, room-scale tracked VR solution look inferior. Whereas last year the VR community was discussing the importance of <i>"Presence,"</i> VR was suddenly all about <a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/valves-chet-faliszek-on-htc-vive-pre-content-showcase-surprises-and-ninja-cats/">not bumping into your cat</a> while you walk and interact around your room.</p><blockquote><p>What VR needs to deliver, if nothing else, is the ability to fool our brain into thinking VR is real. To deliver Presence.</p></blockquote><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/35aa9f7c-913a-49f7-94fc-1c442e9016ee.jpg"><p>If it's to succeed, what VR needs to deliver right now, if nothing else, is the ability to fool our brain into accepting the virtual as real. To deliver <i>Presence</i>.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c72850e7-d41a-4a8f-bdc5-289bbab48c1d.jpg"><p>Presence is the reason the Rift is made of textile materials instead of cheaper plastics, and has the weight distribution of a baseball cap: to ensure the device feels weightless and stays put when we move, to avoid distractions and to help us forget we're wearing a device at all.  </p><p>Presence is the reason for Oculus to have spent resources on a finely calibrated, audiophile quality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAwFN9sFcso">integrated audio solution</a>: to fool our brain into thinking the sounds we hear in VR are sources, not recordings, as accurately positioned in the virtual world as they would be in the real one.</p><p>Presence is also the reason why Oculus opted for the best possible combination of custom optics and displays which, while being similar to those in the HTC Vive, do by most accounts have a slight edge in overall image clarity and in the removal of distracting screen-fill artefacts, commonly known as the Screen Door Effect.</p><p>Finally, Presence is the reason why Oculus has worked in close partnership with Microsoft, and GPU manufacturers nVidia and AMD, to ensure the fastest access to the underlying graphics hardware and to facilitate the implementation of Ansynchronous Time Warp, a difficult to pull off software level solution to ensure head movements in VR appear smooth at all times, masking any occasional game performance drops. </p><p>Yes, Oculus could have invested in a pass-through camera solution. They could also have pushed for their tracked motion controllers, the Oculus Touch, to be made available with the Rift at launch instead of later this year. But they didn't. Not because of lack of resources (Oculus is backed by over USD$2bn of Facebook funding), but because of a strong focus on delivering on the one, most fundamental promise of VR: Presence. </p><blockquote><p>Without Presence, there is no VR</p></blockquote><p>The HTC Vive is an impressive device. Together with its Lighthouse tracking and motion control solution, it's in fact an impressive <i>system</i>. It's an all-in-one, out-of-the-box solution to deliver VR at a physical scale of interaction greater than Oculus's, at least until the second half of the year where we will be able to properly evaluate Oculus's own motion control solution. </p><p>But what the Vive delivers in scale, it lacks in fundamentals. Its displays and optics are just a notch short of what can be achieved in this hardware generation. Its audio solution is generic and at the mercy of what each player's own headphones can deliver. Its ergonomics consist of a comparatively heavy plastic housing paired with elastic straps. </p><p>And while it's true that the Vive's freedom of room-scale movement and controller tracking is a powerful presence multiplier, any VR solution which doesn't first and foremost deliver on those fundamentals of presence is just <i>multiplying by zero</i>.</p><p>So while the Vive can absolutely deliver presence, it is likely to be more fleeting: a dropped frame, a slip of the headset, the weight on the nose, a too-faint or too-loud sound. In VR, any of these seemingly insignificant distractions are enough to break the fragile illusion of Presence, ejecting the player right back into the real world. </p><p>While any and all of these factors will also likely affect the Rift, they're going to be comparatively minimised by the very attention to the fundamentals of VR that has defined Oculus's path to market. Because without those fundamentals, there is no Presence. And without Presence, there is no VR.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="112"><!-- react-empty: 113 --></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 p-1 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-center group-graphical-shape-none  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="114"><div class="Component j-c-center ls-fx-r fx-w-w a-i-start " data-reactid="115"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="116"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="117"><img class="color-loading" data-width="1000" data-height="599" data-ratio="1.669449081803005" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/7b003ec34a175581eb73d60b0c191b16/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F7a8cbea2ce7cbdc5dad6491800cdc5372c47815a.jpg&amp;width=1000" style="object-position:44.05% 56.51085141903172%;" data-reactid="118"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--heading fx-b-50p" data-reactid="119"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="120"><h1 data-reactid="121"><span class="" data-reactid="122"><a href="http://uploadvr.com/magic-leap-announces-mixed-reality-lightfield-amid-huge-funding-round/" class="font-title" data-reactid="123">Magic Leap Raises $794 Million And Announces &quot;Mixed Reality Lightfield&quot;</a></span></h1></div><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="124"><h5 data-reactid="125"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="126"><a href="http://uploadvr.com" data-reactid="127">UploadVR</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 128 --></div></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="129"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="130"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="131"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="132"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="133"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d34d28c7d3723bcbf65dc36e606bcdb5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F094ccdc7f064b043fe9c834e1baf669345b99f72.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:24.0234375% 61.80555555555556%;" data-reactid="134"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d34d28c7d3723bcbf65dc36e606bcdb5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F094ccdc7f064b043fe9c834e1baf669345b99f72.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:24.0234375% 61.80555555555556%;" data-reactid="135"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9d976293ee74d698461f8d4363d3bde9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F094ccdc7f064b043fe9c834e1baf669345b99f72.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:24.0234375% 61.80555555555556%;" data-reactid="136"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fe08c39f8e237467946af9f1153cc4a2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F094ccdc7f064b043fe9c834e1baf669345b99f72.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:24.0234375% 61.80555555555556%;" data-reactid="137"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-ratio="1.7777777777777777" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d34d28c7d3723bcbf65dc36e606bcdb5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F094ccdc7f064b043fe9c834e1baf669345b99f72.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:24.0234375% 61.80555555555556%;" data-reactid="138"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="139"><!-- react-empty: 140 --><!-- react-empty: 141 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="142"><h1 data-reactid="143"><span class="" data-reactid="144"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="145">Guest Post: An MMO for VR</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 146 --><!-- react-empty: 147 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="148"><p data-reactid="149">Could MMO&#x27;s be VR&#x27;s killer app?

In order for an MMO to work in VR, it will have to be designed for that medium and that medium alone. Even the most basic, run of the mill MMO control mechanics, often requiring heavy use of the keyboard, will for example need to be rethought in a VR medium where the physical keyboard is hidden from the user. So what would a VRMMORPG potentially look like? Here are the key factors I believe are needed to bring a viable MMO experience to VR. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="154"><p

After having locked down specs as far back as September, Facebook-owned Oculus VR showcased and launched the finished, polished, consumer-ready Rift at CES. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="278"><p data-reactid="279">Rival HTC, in partnership with Valve, followed this by showcasing the Vive Pre, a compelling but admittedly unfinished product that was still being refined after a high profile delay, and a mere four months ahead of an April launch window. HTC dubbed the Vive Pre their &quot;second generation developer kit.&quot;</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="280"><p data-reactid="281">Despite HTC&#x27;s solid track record in manufacturing mass-market devices, the Pre&#x27;s announcement still stuck many, including ourselves, as an odd move. How could HTC possibly meet a consumer launch deadline in April when they still hadn&#x27;t settled on a final device specification by January? The answer may have more to do with marketing communications than with hardware.  </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="282"><p data-reactid="283">The HTC Vive was originally scheduled for a commercial launch in the holiday 2015 timeframe. On December 18, 2015, HTC tried to put to rest the growing speculation of a missed launch window by announcing on their official blog that they would be </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="284"><p data-reactid="285">Note the language used. In no way does it imply that the April 2016 commercial release applies to anything other than the second developer kit, later dubbed the Vive Pre. Further interviews with HTC reps at CES also featured the same elusive language, reaffirming that the Pre is not the final consumer version, but not explicitly committing to a new, final device revision before the scheduled April launch. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="286"><p data-reactid="287">Whether or not the internet rumours that HTC cancelled a more refined version of the Vive are true, the practicalities of mass device manufacturing would suggest that the Vive Pre is unlikely to see significant hardware changes before April. It therefore follows that HTC may indeed be positioning the Pre as a &quot;soft&quot; commercial launch product in the same way Samsung launched their GearVR Innovator Edition, a not-quite-finished precursor to a more polished commercial device.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="288"><p data-reactid="289">In short, it is likely that HTC will be launching the Vive Pre to &quot;commercial availability&quot; in the same way as Oculus did with their DK2: as a device nominally aimed at developers, but available to anyone wishing to purchase it. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="290"><p data-reactid="291">Doing so would have some clear advantages for HTC: it would buy them time to bring their hardware up to the level of overall polish of the Oculus Rift, while still getting enough of the early devices out there to widen the developer community, and take a slice of the early adopter market. HC would then be well positioned to release a full-fledged consumer Vive midway through the Rift&#x27;s projected 12-18 month lifecycle. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="292"><p data-reactid="293">Anyone hoping for a more &quot;final&quot; consumer device launch from HTC should not be too disappointed however. Whether you call it a developer kit or a consumer product, the HTC Vive remains a solid contender in the Virtual Reality marketplace, trading the polish, ergonomics and integrated positional audio of the Oculus Rift for out-of-the-box room scale tracking and motion controls from day one. </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="294"><p data-reactid="295">Developer kit or not, the Vive Pre will also be positioned as the de-facto proving ground for a whole new generation of VR experiences exploring the possibilities of large spaces and motion controls, at least until the Oculus Touch controller solution launches in the second half of this year.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="296"><p data-reactid="297">We still don&#x27;t know how the HTC Vive Pre will be priced in comparison to the Rift&#x27;s $599 price point (excluding motion controls), so the choice for consumers as to which device to pick can still be a difficult one. Compared to cost and capabilities, however, the fact that the Vive Pre may remain a &quot;mere&quot; developer kit for some time is unlikely to strongly influence the early adopter market will make up the majority of this year&#x27;s Virtual Reality demographic. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="13" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-13vw p-v-4 color-bg  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="298"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="299"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="300"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="301"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="14" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="302"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="303"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="304"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="305"><span data-reactid="306"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="307"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="308"/></a><h2 data-reactid="309"><a data-reactid="310">ɅUGMΞNTL.IO</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="311"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="312"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="313"><div class="Link" data-reactid="314"><a data-reactid="315"></a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="316"><a data-reactid="317">ɅUGMΞNTL RSS</a></div><div class="Link" data-reactid="318"><a data-reactid="319">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="320"></div></section></div></div>
