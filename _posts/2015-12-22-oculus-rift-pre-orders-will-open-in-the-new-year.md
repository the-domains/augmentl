# Oculus Rift Pre-Orders Will Open in The New Year

Oculus founder Palmer lucky confirms Oculus release on track, announcing pre-orders will open in the new year.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), December 22nd 2015\.

In an unexpected tweet today, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey confirmed that manufacturing of the Oculus Rift for commercial release is still [on track][1] for an "_awesome_" Q1 release.

Palmer further [reassured][2] the VR community that pre-orders would be opened in the new year, and with prior warning. This was no doubt aimed at addressing the rampant speculation on when Oculus might open the floodgates to their device's pre-orders, an event that many in the enthusiastic VR community have been anticipating more than the holidays themselves.

With the HTC Vive recently [delayed until 2016][3], It's looking like the two competing VR solutions will be entering the market neck-and-neck next year, with Oculus likely to open their pre-orders just before HTC's announced February 2016 date.

At least for now however, the VR community can focus on enjoying the holidays without fear of missing a vital pre-order slot.
