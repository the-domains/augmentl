description: 'This week, Microsoft brought a demonstration of its newest augmented reality product, the HoloLens, to my home down of Phoenix, AZ. The Microsoft reps refer to this experience as "mixed reality," it uses a set of goggles that set a transparent screen on your face and add virtual "holograms" to the world in front of your face that you can interact with via voice and gesture.'
