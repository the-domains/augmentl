description: 'When we first met the team building the LucidCam, they aimed to raise $100,000 on Indiegogo. They found their 264 backers to get them there. Their goal remains to bring the ability to shoot immersive virtual reality content with a camera that fits in your pocket. And at a reasonable price ($299).'
