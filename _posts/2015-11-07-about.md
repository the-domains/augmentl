It's been a while, but Augmentl is back, in a whole new incarnation powered by The Grid. The design may have changed (and is still evolving) but the same keen eye on all news related to Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality technologies remains. So whether you're desperate for news on MagicLeap, of eagerly awaiting new releases from Oculus and SteamVR, stick around: we have you covered.

You can also find us on twitter at [@augmentl][0] for the latest updates.

> Stay real, enjoy virtual.
