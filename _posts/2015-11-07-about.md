# **Virtual Reality Matters**

It's been a while, but Augmentl is back in a whole new incarnation powered by The Grid. 

The 
design may have changed, but the same keen eye on all news related to Augmented, Mixed, 
and Virtual Reality technologies remains. 

**We have one simple goal: to be your single source of updates for all AR and VR news.**

Maintained by industry insiders, [Augmentl.io][0] is continuously updated with content hand-picked from from a large number of sources in the VR and AR space, from insider news to 
major media properties. We strive to only feature a selection of the most important, 
influential developments in the industry, to cut through the noise of these rapidly growing 
technologies. 

So whether you're desperate for news on MagicLeap, of eagerly awaiting new releases from 
Oculus and SteamVR, stick around: we have you covered. And if you'd like to write with us,
[get in touch][1]! 

You can also find us on twitter.  Follow [@augmentl][1] for the latest updates. 

Live in the real, play in the virtual.
