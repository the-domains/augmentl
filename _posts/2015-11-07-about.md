**We're all about AR and VR.**

It's been a while, but Augmentl is back in a whole new incarnation powered by The Grid. The design may have changed, but the same keen eye on all news related to Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality technologies remains. 

Maintained by industry insiders, Augmentl.io is continuously updated with content hand-picked from from a large number of sources in the VR and AR space, from insider news to major media properties. We strive to only feature a selection of the most important, influential developments in the industry, to cut through the noise of these rapidly growing technologies. 

So whether you're desperate for news on MagicLeap, of eagerly awaiting new releases from Oculus and SteamVR, stick around: we have you covered.

You can also find us on twitter. Follow [@augmentl][0] for the latest updates.

Live in the real, play in the virtual.
