# Oculus Just Pulled the Ultimate Classy Move 

A "small token of appreciation" to its original backers sets a new precedent in Kickstarter history.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 5th 2016\. 

In what is sure to set a historic precedent in good Kickstarter behaviour (outclassing even [CastAR's][1] recent classy move), Oculus have announced that they will be giving away a free [Kickstarter Edition Rift][2] to every single backer of their original 2011 Kickstarter campaign. In a project update that no doubt came as a late Christmas surprise to all its recipients, Oculus stated that

> "As a small token of our appreciation for your support, all Kickstarter backers who pledged for a Rift development kit will get a free Kickstarter Edition Oculus Rift! And like all Rift pre-order purchasers, you'll receive a bundled copy of Lucky's Tale and EVE: Valkyrie."

Kickstarter backers will be able to claim their free Rift following tomorrow's opening of pre-orders for the device. This is an amazing move by Oculus, not just a great PR win and also a (hopefully) final nail in the coffin for the argument that by joining Facebook, Oculus had somehow sold out its grassroots community.
If you're a Kickstarter backer, congratulations. 

For the rest of us, we will still be able to pre-order the Rift following tomorrow's CES announcement.
