# The New Meta 2 Augmented Reality Headset Demonstrates One Point: AR is Hard.

At first glance, the Meta 2 is an impressive realisation of our sci-fi dreams. But a closer look reveals a reality of tempered ambitions.

By [Augmentl][0], March 2nd 2016

The new Meta 2 headset is undoubtedly interesting. Like Microsoft's HoloLens and the ever secretive Magic Leap technology, the Meta 2 pulls off the difficult trick  of anchoring 3D digital content onto real-world environments. To the user, it provides a hologram-like experience. Unlike the HoloLens, however, the Meta 2 also lets its users manipulate these holograms with their bare hands, letting them twist, pick up, slap and poke these digital artefacts as one would a physical object.

Or, at least, that's what it's trying to do. In actual fact, the anchoring is jittery - the digital content's connection to the physical world can appear twitchy and unsteady as the user moves and looks around. Picking up and interacting with digital objects also kind-of-works, providing the sort of semi-reliable, unsteady interaction that's more remindful of the old, pre-Orion Leap Motion implementation than the level of precision achievable with the Oculus Touch or HTC Vive's motion controllers.

Then there's the Meta 2's actual form, a huge, protruding visor holding what appears to be a full-size mobile screen at 90ยบ to the user's forehead, to be reflected by an angled semi-transparent surface. Sure, the new design claims to provide a very respectble 90ยบ field of view (compared to HoloLens's paltry and claustrophobic 40ยบ), but at the cost of both weight and size. 

And finally, there's the fact that the whole thing is tethered. That's right, for a device meant for Augmented Reality, it looks like the only real-world environment to which you'll be attaching digital holograms will be the environment immediately surrounding your PC.  

Once we look past the cool TED demos and the Tony-Stark like holographic interactions, in fact, we see that the Meta 2 is two things: a device coming to terms with the difficulties of AR, and the product of a company coming to terms with its own limitations. 

As Meta's second development kit, the Meta 2 is arguably a sobering step back from its early ambitions: an un-tethered pair of aviator-style digital glasses with built-in Kinect-like sensors for hand detection. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/69b41e03-2fc5-486b-b49d-3ece224633a9.jpg)

The slick, more ambitious Meta Pro prototype (pictured), which the company had made available for pre-order [as far back as 2013][1], is currently nowhere to be found on the [Meta site][2].  Its dedicated site, spaceglasses.com, has been abandoned. It's like it never existed. 

The Meta 2 might have been more impressive one or two years back, before HoloLens gave us a tantalising glimpse of what an untethered AR device could (and could not) achieve. But today, the Meta 2 stands out as an awkward, if perhaps pragmatic, compromise - an admission of defeat in the face of technology challenges that are still far from being resolved. 

At $949, the Meta 2 does  give developers interested in tinkering with the opportunities of AR a competitive entry point against the $3000 HoloLens, but it's unlikely to appeal to a broad audience. And that's ok. AR is today where VR was three years ago, when the Oculus Rift DK1 was the best VR experience a mere mortal could get their hands on. And those humble beginnings spurred a multi-billion dollar industry and the polished experiences of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive.

If, despite its compromises, the Meta 2 becomes the Oculus DK1 of the AR world, it will have at least served an important role in the development of a new industry. But that's a big if.
