# The HTC Vive May be Heading for a Soft Launch

The Virtual Reality solution HTC showed at CES 2016, the Vive Pre, was not the final consumer model. But it may still be all that HTC consumers will get for some time. 

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 19 2016\.

2016, the "year of VR" was meant to see the first two consumer-ready Virtual Reality solutions hit the shelves in the first half  of the year. After having locked down specs as far back as September, Facebook-owned Oculus VR showcased and launched the finished, polished, consumer-ready Rift at CES. 

Rival HTC, in partnership with Valve, followed this by showcasing the Vive Pre, a compelling but admittedly unfinished product that was still being refined after a high profile delay, and a mere four months ahead of an April launch window. HTC dubbed the Vive Pre their _"second generation developer kit."_

Despite HTC's solid track record in manufacturing mass-market devices, the Pre's announcement still stuck many, [including ourselves][1], as an odd move. How could HTC possibly meet a consumer launch deadline in April when they still hadn't settled on a final device specification by January? The answer may have more to do with marketing communications than with hardware.  

The HTC Vive was originally scheduled for a commercial launch in the holiday 2015 timeframe. On December 18, 2015, HTC tried to put to rest the growing speculation of a missed launch window by [announcing][2] on their official blog that they would be 
> 
> "launching the second generation of the HTC Vive Developer Kit at CES \[...\] starting the new year by making an additional 7,000 units available to developers, with pre-orders from the end of February followed by commercial availability in April 2016."

Note the language used. In no way does it imply that the April 2016 commercial release applies to anything other than the second developer kit, later dubbed the Vive Pre. [Further interviews][3] with HTC reps at CES also featured the same elusive language, reaffirming that the Pre is not the final consumer version, but not explicitly committing to a new, final device revision before the scheduled April launch. 

Whether or not the [internet rumours][4] that HTC cancelled a more refined version of the Vive are true, the practicalities of mass device manufacturing would suggest that the Vive Pre is unlikely to see significant hardware changes before April. It therefore follows that HTC may indeed be positioning the Pre as a "soft" commercial launch product in the same way Samsung launched their GearVR Innovator Edition, a not-quite-finished precursor to a more polished commercial device.

In short, it is likely that HTC will be launching the Vive Pre to "commercial availability" in the same way as Oculus did with their DK2: as a device nominally aimed at developers, but available to anyone wishing to purchase it. 

Doing so would have some clear advantages for HTC: it would buy them time to bring their hardware up to the level of overall polish of the Oculus Rift, while still getting enough of the early devices out there to widen the developer community, and take a slice of the early adopter market. HC would then be well positioned to release a full-fledged consumer Vive midway through the Rift's projected 12-18 month [lifecycle][5]. 

Anyone hoping for a more "final" consumer device launch from HTC should not be too disappointed however. Whether you call it a developer kit or a consumer product, the HTC Vive remains a solid contender in the Virtual Reality marketplace, trading the polish, ergonomics and integrated positional audio of the Oculus Rift for out-of-the-box room scale tracking and motion controls from day one. 

Developer kit or not, the Vive Pre will also be positioned as the de-facto proving ground for a whole new generation of VR experiences exploring the possibilities of large spaces and motion controls, at least until the Oculus Touch controller solution launches in the second half of this year.

We still don't know how the HTC Vive Pre will be priced in comparison to the Rift's $599 price point (excluding motion controls), so the choice for consumers as to which device to pick can still be a difficult one. Compared to cost and capabilities, however, the fact that the Vive Pre may remain a "mere" developer kit for some time is unlikely to strongly influence the early adopter market will make up the majority of this year's Virtual Reality demographic. 

Whichever way early adopters choose to go, and whichever way these competing devices are marketed, there is no wrong choice: VR is off to a great start.
