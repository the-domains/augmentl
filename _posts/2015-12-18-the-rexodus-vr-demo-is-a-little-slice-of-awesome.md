# The Rexodus VR Demo is a Little Slice of Awesome

The latest VR short by Steelehouse brings a Dark Horse comic to life.

Let me start with an admission: I'd never heard of Rexodus before today. So if you happen, like me, to have missed this colourful Dark Horse comic up until now, this summary from the official page should help:

> 64.9 million years ago, the earth was ruled by dinosaurs --- a species far more advanced than their fossil record would ever reveal. Leveraging the power of lava as their primary fuel source, the dinosaurs' civilization grew unchecked for millions of years. That is, until the BLACK BLOOD ARRIVED.

As it happens, that short summary is more than you actually need to know to enjoy the newly released [Rexodus VR][0] experience, a short demo by the creative studio Steelehouse which, while barely interactive, manages to be both a visual treat and an enticing taste of what could be.

In order to avoid major spoilers I'll refrain from going into too much detail about what happens in the experience, so suffice to say that much of it consists of looking around luxuriously detailed comic-book styled surroundings while being spoken to by a succession of beautifully rendered and animated characters from the comic.

Built on the Unreal engine, Rexodus VR showcases what you can achieve when you combine meticulously modeled characters with Temporal Antialiasing, 4K textures and positional audio. Even on the now ageing Oculus Rift DK2 the graphics were flawlessly smooth, bright, and vivid. So vivid in fact that the DK2's prominent and dreaded "screen door effect" was instantly forgotten. And to Steelehouse's further credit, I ran the demo on an Nvidia 780Ti and still experienced an absolutely seamless experience.

Rexodus VR is by no means perfect: running it on version 0.8 of the Oculus Runtime, I had to button-mash the Xbox controller to get it to move on from an initial black screen. The experience's positional sound sources could also have been more accurately placed with relation to the on-screen dialog, although the small discrepancies were not enough to be distracting.

I also happened to notice, on a second run of the experience, that the occasional interaction prompts telling me to look in one direction or another really had no effect on the progression of the experience. At the same time I couldn't help but be impressed by the level of immersion, if not quite presence, that the experience managed to convey despite this completely illusory sense of agency.

The Rexodus VR demo seems to be taking a strong cue from some of the announced VR experiences from Oculus Story Studio, like [Henry][1], and in doing so serves as a good demonstration of the effectiveness of minimally interactive, character driven experiences in Virtual Reality. 

If anything Rexodus, like Henry and others like it, provides further evidence that experiences that let the user be an observer within the action, rather than an active participant in it, could prove highly effective in VR - freeing the user from the cognitive stresses of interaction while letting the mind [simply accept the illusion][2].

Rexodus VR stands today as a weird, delightful hybrid of comic, game, and stage play. Whichever way Steelehouse decide to take it from here, I have a feeling it'll be worth the wait.

Oh and one last thing: **watch out for the black blood**.
