# The Rexodus VR Demo is a Little Slice of Awesome

The latest VR short by Steelehouse brings a Dark Horse comic to life.

Let me start with an admission: I'd never heard of Rexodus before today. So if you happen, like me, to have missed this colourful Dark Horse comic up until now, this summary from the official page should help:

> 64.9 million years ago, the earth was ruled by dinosaurs --- a species far more advanced than their fossil record would ever reveal. Leveraging the power of lava as their primary fuel source, the dinosaurs' civilization grew unchecked for millions of years. That is, until the BLACK BLOOD ARRIVED.

As it happens, that short summary is more than you actually need to know to enjoy the newly released [Rexodus VR][0] experience, a short demo by the creative studio Steelehouse which, while barely interactive, manages to be both a visual treat and an enticing taste of what could be.

In order to avoid major spoilers I'll refrain from going into too much detail about what happens in the experience, so suffice to say that much of it consists of looking around luxuriously detailed comic-book styled surroundings while being spoken to by a succession of beautifully rendered and animated characters from the comic.

Built on the Unreal engine, Rexodus VR showcases what you can achieve when you combine meticulously modeled characters with Temporal Antialiasing, 4K textures and positional audio. Even on the now ageing Oculus Rift DK2 the graphics were flawlessly smooth, bright, and vivid. So vivid in fact that the DK2's prominent and dreaded "screen door effect" was instantly forgotten. And to Steelehouse's further credit, I ran the demo on an Nvidia 780Ti and still experienced an absolutely seamless experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/638a3010-3c8a-47df-8150-10ab1407c321.png)

The demo is by no means perfect of course. Its positional sound sources could be more accurately placed with relation to the on-screen dialog, and I noticed on a second run that the interaction prompts to look in one direction or another really have no effect on the progression of the experience. But  at the same time I was impressed with the level of immersion (if not quite presence) that the short experience managed to convey. 

Taking a cue from Oculus Story Studio's upcoming VR experiences like [Henry][1], the Rexodus VR demo also serves as a good demonstration of the effectiveness of minimally interactive, character driven experiences in Virtual Reality - where simply playing the part of an observer in the middle of the action, rather than an active participant in it, can still prove both entertaining and immersive. 

In its current state Rexodus VR is a weird, delightful hybrid of comic, game, and stage play. It's not clear where it wants to go from here. Whichever way Steelehouse decide to take it  however, I have a feeling it'll be worth the wait.

Oh and one last thing: **watch out for the black blood**.
