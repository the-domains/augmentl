# Being There: A New ArchViz Demo With A Twist

VR is perfect for the visualization of beautiful architecture. But what if there's more to it than just exploring a space?

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), December 30th 2015\.

Anyone with access to a VR headset has probably come across ArchViz, a whole category of Virtual Reality experiences dedicated to the visualization of gorgeous, aspirational architectural marvels. 

But what if the expectation of calm reflection typical of these experiences was suddenly shattered?

This simple idea is what I wanted to explore with my first Unreal Engine 4.10 demo, which served as both an incredibly fun learning experience as well as a way of exploring some genre-crossover concepts I had been thinking about.

So without further ado, Please enjoy
