# Palmer Luckey on the Rift's Pricing Strategy: "Tesla is a Good Example"

An insight into Oculus's vision for the future of VR reveals how Elon Musk's Tesla was an inspiration.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 11 2016\.

One of the more interesting tidbits in the recent [Reddit AMA][1] with Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was in relation to a question on the Rift's launch pricing, which struck many as higher than expected for a device long claimed as serving the role of shepherd to the advent of consumer VR.

The Rift launched this week at $599, raising questions as to whether its high price point, and its requirement of a substantial PC in order to run, wouldn't be deterrents to the wide adoption of VR. How could mass-market acceptance of this new technology be achieved when its flagship product was out of most consumers price range? 

Palmer answered this question by referring to Elon Musk's strategy for Tesla, a pioneer in the electric car industry: 
> 
> "Tesla is a good example - Elon Musk had to convince the public that electric cars could be awesome before he could build the technology that would actually make electric cars mainstream." 

Palmer also commented on how his position on the Rift's pricing changed from the early days, when he used to believe VR could only cost _"$300 and run on a decent PC."_
That was until he realised that in order to deliver VR's most compelling quality,
presence
, more needed to be invested into the device. 
> 
> "The Rift is the first headset capable of delivering presence, the sensation of feeling like you are inside a virtual scene on a subconscious level... VR needs to become something everyone wants before it can become something everyone can afford"

It's difficult to argue that the Rift has not been an aspirational device, having after all been the keystone to the birth of an entire emerging industry with investments in the billions. What remains to be seen is how quickly, rather than whether, VR can evolve to encompass a more consumer-friendly price point.
