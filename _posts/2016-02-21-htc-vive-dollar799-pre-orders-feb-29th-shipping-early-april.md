# HTC Vive: $799, Pre-Orders Feb 29th, Shipping Early April

The HTC official blog today confirmed details of the consumer Vive: It's a Vive Pre, minus the Pre.

by [Augmentl][0], February 21st 2016

Today the official [HTC blog][1] unveiled more details on the HTC Vive's commercial release:

* Pre-orders open February 29th
* The US price will be $799
* It will include Job Simulator and Fantastic Contraption

The news may come as somewhat of a disappointment to die-hard fans who were hoping for a greater departure from the Vive Pre development kit, but not to those who'd been carefully watching the market. In HTC's own words, the consumer Vive is effectively a rebrand of the Pre with minor changes:

> Taking Vive one step further, with refreshed branding and an updated head strap, the Vive consumer edition builds upon the innovative features that were introduced into the Vive Pre 

Our previous analysis of HTC's announcements at CES had [speculated][2] as to the possibility of the Pre being very close the final consumer device, and it seems HTC followed through on that prediction. 

That said, the Vive remains a highly competitive player in the VR space, and brings with it some unique features such as first-to-market support for room-scale tracked motion controllers (The Oculus Rift's own Touch controllers are slated for later in the year).

The new Vive also brings with it another new feature: the ability to connect to your smartphone and let you answer calls while in VR. Together with the Chaperone safety system and front-facing camera, this is another example of HTC thinking more broadly about keeping the user connected to the real-world while in VR, although conversely the presence of these features could also be seen as potentially immersion-breaking. 

The Vive's $799 US price is unlikely to generate the same outrage as the Rift's $599 price reveal, due in large part to the latter's priming of the market and HTC's past positioning of the Vive as a _"premium VR experience."_ The pricing also gives Oculus a $150-$200 price range for their upcoming Touch motion controllers, if they wish to remain price competitive with the Vive bundle. 

With both the Rift and the HTC Vive prices being in line with each other, the biggest decision consumers now have to make will be based on content, and on whether they are prepared to wait until the Touch release in order to enjoy motion controllers in their VR experiences.
