description: "Tracking is the foundation of great virtual reality. Knowing the position and orientation of the user's head is essential to being able to move the virtual world convincingly around them as they move through it. Oculus and Valve/HTC have the leading tracking systems (dubbed 'Constellation' and 'Lighthouse', respectively), but soon a new entrant could join the VR tracking arena."
