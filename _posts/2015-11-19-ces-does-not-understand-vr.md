There's no graceful way to put this. Vuzix's [recently announced][0] win of the CES 2016 Innovation Award in the Gaming and Virtual Reality category is undeserved.

The past year has seen the field of consumer virtual reality take a massive step closer to mass market, with a veritable surge in investment in hardware and software alike. Competition on the hardware side has also been healthy, with Valve and HTC entering the fray and threatening to scoop the first-to-market position which only a year ago seemed to be in the hands of Facebook's Oculus VR. Samsung's GearVR followed the launch of last year's GearVR Innovator Edition with a mass-market product launch, and the OSVR initiative has started gaining some traction with the release of their first open development kits for VR. So how is it, that among all this, a company selling a pair of movie-watching goggles based on positively ageing micro-display technology manage to bag an award in the Virtual Reality category?

The [Vuzix iWear][1] is primarily marketed as a set of video headphones. It is specifically designed to replicate the effect of watching TV in a portable form factor very reminiscent of last year's (arguably superior) [Avegant Glyph][2]. 

The iWear sports a Field of View of merely 57º, basic IMU rotational tracking, absolutely no positional tracking, and is wholly, unambiguously not suitable for use as a Virtual Reality headset. If all these specs mean little to you let's put it this way: the Vuzix iWear is to a VR headset what a hot tub is to SCUBA diving. Despite Vuzix's casually deceptive mention of VR in its marketing materials, the iWear is not, by any definition, deserving of any award in either the Gaming or Virtual Reality categories.

> The Vuzix iWear is to a VR headset what a hot tub is to SCUBA diving.

So what's the deal with CES awarding this company with an innovation award in our beloved Virtual Reality category? Why not award it to Valve's Lighthouse tech, or even to OSVR's open SDK? Who did Vuzix have to pay to win this award? Where can we buy pitchforks in bulk? The truth is, Vuzix is not to blame. The CES Awards Committee is.

You see, the real problem here is one of definition. Firstly, lumping "Gaming" and "Virtual Reality" under the same award does a disservice to VR, a technology whose applications span far beyond entertainment to encompass training, education, architecture, engineering, medicine and many more. Secondly, the accepted definition of VR is currently so loose as to be easily applied (mistakenly, in this author's humble opinion) to things like 360º videos. Essentially, anything that sticks some moving images in front of one's eyes can currently claim, with relative impunity, to be playing in the ever-so-trendy Virtual Reality arena.

This is only natural. Despite the concept of VR having been with us for decades the actual real-world, practical advent of the technology in a non-research capacity is barely a few years old. We're only now starting to see the first consumer applications of VR hitting the market, and with all the investment going into anything sporting the "VR" suffix it's only natural to expect companies to jump on the bandwagon, deservedly or otherwise. Remember [3DHead][3]? Exactly.

Sure, CES should know better. An event generally accepted as the Mecca of all consumer technology should do a better job of encouraging this exciting new market segment with its own well-defined awards category, and reward innovation within it accordingly. It should make sure to help promote "good" VR rather than helping to blur the definition even further. But maybe VR also needs to define itself, to transition from the theoretical ideal of VR to the successful mass-market applications that undeniably define what VR actually is. And that may take some time.

So when CES Innovation Awards finally feature their own Virtual Reality category, we'll know one thing for sure: VR is here to stay.
