description: 'Tablets can be very useful in places like factories, with maintenance workers being able to carry them around and check on tasks as they go. Soon, however, factory workers might not need to carry anything around, with researchers in Japan working on a system that will transform the human body into tablet, touchpads, keyboards and so on, enabling them to keep their hands free for other things.'
