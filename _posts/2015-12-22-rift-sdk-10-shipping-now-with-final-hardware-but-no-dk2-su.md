# Rift SDK 1.0 Shipping Now with Final Hardware, But No DK2 Support Yet.

Oculus is directing developers with apps releasing in Q1 to request final Rift hardware, suggesting Oculus is on track for an imminent pre-order announcement. Support for the DK2 however has not been mentioned.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), December 22ns 2015\.

This morning Oculus developers received an email stating the following:

_"If you're shipping a Rift title in Q1, you'll need early access to Rift hardware and new platform features to finalize your game or application. The Rift SDK 1.0 and runtime include features tied to the consumer product, so we've currently limited the release to developers putting final touches on launch titles."_

Oculus has also asked developers to submit their applications via the Oculus submission tool, and that new Rift hardware was being shipped to developers every week in the run up to launch. Developers have also been advised that until they obtain final Rift hardware, DK2 and SDK 0.8 are the right platforms to continue developing on. 

It is unclear if that implies that SDK 1.0 will be dropping DK2 compatibility, as that would hamper and alienate Oculus's current developer and enthusiast community. It's more likely that SDK 1.0 will be released more broadly in the next few weeks following an official announcement of the Rift's commercial release date.

Nvidia has also released a [new set of drivers][1] with support for GameWorksVR SLI and the latest Oculus Rift SDK. 

Today's communication does confirm that Oculus is on track for a Q1 '16 release, and is making sure developers planning a simultaneous release of their applications have access to final commercial hardware. If Oculus are true to their earlier goal of announcing availability for the Rift before the end of 2015, we should expect pre-orders to be announced in the next few days.
