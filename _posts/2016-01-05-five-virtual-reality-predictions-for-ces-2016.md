# Five Virtual Reality Predictions for CES 2016

CES 2016 is upon us. Oculus will open preorders for the Rift. HTC will unveil its new Vive. It's like Christmas for VR enthusiasts. But what else will we see, and why? Here's what we think.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 5th 2015\.

**Prediction 1: Oculus will demo 360ยบ room-scale Touch experiences, announce SDK 1.0\.**

Yesterday's  Oculus finally put months of hype and speculation to rest by officially announcing that pre-orders for the consumer version of the Rift will open following their CES session tomorrow.  

On a Reddit thread on the same day speculating on the device's release price, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey [stated][1] that _"A ton of stuff is going to be shown on the 6th, giving everybody a price in a vacuum makes no sense."_

Oculus also recently stated, in an [official blog post][2] announcing a delay for the Oculus Touch motion controllers, that _"There will be a huge amount of ground-breaking new content launching alongside Touch. We shared a handful of early previews at Oculus Connect 2 in September, but we can't wait to show you what's coming next." _

Reading somewhat between the lines, It's not unreasonable to speculate that Oculus will be making their case as to why consumers should buy into the Rift now and wait on the Touch later this year rather than holding out for the HTC Vive, the Rift's only real competition in the PC VR market. To do this effectively Oculus will also have to demonstrate that the Touch, and its Constellation-based tracking, can effectively compete with the Vive's Lighthouse tracking solution, which has been demonstrated working effectively at room-scale with full 360ยบ tracking.

Finally, given the short time between tomorrow's opening of Rift pre-orders and an expected shipping date before the end of March, it's also likely that we'll hear when version 1.0 of the Oculus SDK will be released - or may even see it made available tomorrow. Releasing SDK 1.0 to the developer community will set a stake in the ground for developer confidence, and ensure that developers have enough time to move their projects to the new SDK before the Rift hits consumer hands.

**Prediction 2: HTC's big breakthrough will turn out to be optics and display refinements**

We've speculated about this before, shortly after HTC's announcement of their initial "breakthrough" in December last year. Since then, there's also been a lot of talk about other possible breakthroughs, from room-mapping 3D cameras to full body tracking courtesy of the recently announced partnership between HTC and Dassault Systemes. 

We're still reasonably confident that Optics and Display are the two areas where HTC Vive is most likely to get some improvement, particularly given the limited timeframe between now and its stated April release timeframe. But we would love to be wrong. 

**Prediction 3: We'll see a ton of mostly Chinese VR cash-ins, mostly of poor quality.**

If the recent outing of the laughably vaporous [Dlodlo V One][3] "VR" headset is any indication, we should be in for a treat as smaller manufacturers rush to cash into the VR hype with hastily put together devices of varying quality. Most of the focus is likely to be on the mobile sector, where a "Cardboard Plus" experience presents a lower barrier to entry for new players wishing to jump onto the VR bandwagon. We can also expect players in the AR sphere (I'm looking at you, [Vuzix][4]) to try and grab some of the attention. Look out for this year's answer to last year's [3DHead][5].

**Prediction 4: We'll get a closer look at Playstation VR, but no launch date**

The Playstation VR has received a steadily increase in press in the past few months, and much is already known about its hardware and software ecosystem. The one thing missing is a launch date. 

Sony is due for their CES announcements [tomorrow night][6] at 5pm EST, and we can expect a closer look at the PSVR's hardware, its [breakout box][7], and perhaps some information on pricing. A release date however will likely wait until E3 2016, traditionally a more appropriate time to break the news on new console products. Sony is not in direct competition with Oculus or HTC for the VR market, so they can afford to take their time.

**Prediction 5: We will hear a lot about how VR will revolutionise \[insert industry here\]**

One certain consequence of tomorrow's announcements is this: The Virtual Reality hype train will accelerate to the point of derailment. We're already seeing a lot of informed and not so informed press about how VR will revolutionise one industry or another, and this will only ramp up following the announcement of concrete dates when actual consumers will be able to get their hands on the technology. Expect the signal-to-noise ratio to dip for a few weeks, until things cool down.
