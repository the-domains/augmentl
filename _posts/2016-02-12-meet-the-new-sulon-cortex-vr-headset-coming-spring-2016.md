# Meet The New Sulon Cortex VR Headset, Coming Spring 2016

We took a peek behind the curtain of Sulon's secretive website to get a glimpse at what's coming.

by [Augmentl][0], 12th February 2016

The Sulon Cortex is an ambitious Virtual Reality headset. Equipped with environment-sensing cameras, it promised to seamlessly map and integrate the digital into the physical in a unique VR/AR hybrid experience. Or, according to Sulon themselves:

> Turn your surrounding environment into an augmented or virtual reality experience through Sulon's "spatially aware" headset. The Sulon HMD brings virtual and augmented technologies that revolutionize the way people live, work and play. This wearable head mounted computing platform enables an immersive experience that will open your mind to new possibilities.

Since demonstrating their [earlier prototypes][1] in the middle of 2015, Sulon have been pretty quiet. Their current website offers little more than a teaser, with a Spring 2016 launch window.

**Enhance!**

We decided to see what was hiding behind [the site's][2] teaser images, mere outlines of the headset shrouded in shadow. Using our CSI like Photoshop skills, here's what we got:

It doesn't look like much, but what that rendering reveals is a significantly more compact version of the fully untethered, self-contained VR headset Sulon had previously shown, absent the neon hexagonal designs that made the old version (below) look like a prop in a SyFy movie of the week. ![The previous iteration of the Sulon Cortex](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5a850aa-a8c2-4cb0-ade8-fdb97f87948b.png)

So there we have it. Whether these images are in any way representative of the final product, we'll have to wait until at least Spring 2016 to find out. In the meantime, we can only speculate as to how Sulon plan to make an entrance into what's a very different, more competitive market for VR compared to 2015\. 

Who knows: _room-sensing_ could be the new _room-scale_.
