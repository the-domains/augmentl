# In case you missed it: The Chaotic Aftermath of the Rift's Release

Anger, vitriol, and enthusiasm. Welcome to the Virtual Reality thunder dome. A retrospective on the historic launch of the world's first consumer VR headset for PC enthusiasts.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 7th 2015\.

Yesterday, at exactly 4pm UTC, saw the consumer release of the Oculus Rift. The opening of pre-orders for the device was the culmination of over three years of Research and Development, grassroots support and the creation of an enthusiastic (and vocal) VR community. 

The event was also an object lesson on the setting of expectations, on consumer entitlement, and on the perils and benefits of  close community engagement.  What followed Oculus's CES announcement was nothing short of chaos, but behind all the noise one fact remains:  VR is here. And it's just the beginning.

It all started with a figure: $599, the US dollar launch price of the Rift (pre-tax). The price reveal sent immediate shockwaves through the VR enthusiast community, with a vocal minority of Reddit users flooding the [/r/Oculus][1] subreddit for several hours with dozens of new threads complaining about the high price of the device. These were followed by threats to "defect" to the HTC Vive (Whose price is still unannounced) and comments implying Oculus had somehow betrayed its earlier promises of pitching the consumer device in the $350 ballpark.

While many such threads may have smacked of entitlement (It's unlikely we'd hear the same about a similarly priced device from Apple), they did highlight the disparity between the expectations that Oculus had set in their communications with their community and the realities of manufacturing an marketing cutting-edge hardware, albeit allegedly at a heavily subsidised price.

Oculus founder Palmer Luckey acknowledged as much in his follow-up [AMA][2], where he accepted responsibility for not having effectively communicated Oculus's internal shift in position from affordability to maximum quality for their first commercial device:

> I handled the messaging poorly. Earlier last year, we started officially messaging that the Rift+Recommended spec PC would cost roughly $1500\. That was around the time we committed to the path of prioritizing quality over cost, trying to make the best VR headset possible with current technology... There are a lot of reasons we did not do a better job of prepping people who already have high end GPUs, legal, financial, competitive, and otherwise, but to be perfectly honest, our biggest failing was assuming we had been clear enough about setting expectations. - Palmer Luckey

Palmer's AMA did go some way towards calming the waters, and the real-world impact of the so-called "backlash" seems to have been minimal - certainly compared to the actual impact of the pre-order process itself.

Within instants of the the official countdown to pre-orders on the Oculus store reaching zero, eager customers found themselves staring at a blank screen. Those lucky enough to get to the order page were greeted with repeated error messages, re-load failures, and permanent spinning wheels. Some allegedly had their banks suspend their payment cards following repeated $1 verification charges by Oculus's shopping infrastructure, caused by the repeated attempts at completing their orders. According to Palmer, this was partly due to a massive and sustained attack by so-called "script-kiddies," which resulted in a number of fraudulent orders having to be cleared from the system.

Yet, within the first 10 minutes the expected shipping dates shown on the site went from March to April - then to May, and now to June. Palmer confirmed in a tweet that they'd sold in ten minutes what they thought would sell in hours. The Reddit community scrambled to make sense of it all, even going as far as trying to create [correlation graphs][3] between order numbers and shipping estimates (A doomed effort, as the order numbers were confirmed by Oculus to be randomly generated). Even today, customers are still anxiously waiting for confirmation of their orders. 

What's clear is that, despite Apple-esque system failures and a pre-order experience marred by technical issues, the Rift's pre-orders were snapped up faster than anyone was expecting. It's worth bearing in mind however that, as non-binding and without any charges until shipping, some of those pre-orders may yet be cancelled by those who simply wanted a guaranteed place in line while they considered the purchase more thoroughly. Between those and the fraudulent orders the Oculus support team is currently clearing from their databases, it'll be a few days before we can expect to hear the true number of units ordered.

So far, all we know is that the first batch of Rifts will be shipped to 20 countries on March 28th, and that anyone lucky enough to have completed their pre-order within the first 10 to 14 minutes after opening is likely to be in that batch. Those who did not make the initial cut may have to wait until between April and June until they get their hands on the Rift. Oculus buyers also have a lot of content to look forward to, with over [100 VR specific titles][4] due out before the end of 2016\.

If you don't mind the $599 price, and having to wait until June for your order, you can still [get your name on the list][5]. Many VR enthusiasts and interested consumers however will be waiting to see how the market develops, with the HTC Vive due to open their pre-orders in February for an estimated shipping of April. The Vive bundle will also include motion controllers - so the big question for many is, will Oculus ship their Touch controllers in time for the Vive's release? 

With camps of vocal and enthusiastic fans already forming and drawing battle lines, which VR device will be crowned king by the end of 2016? How will the upcoming Playstation VR fare against its PC competitors? We'll have to wait and see. Either way, VR just got real. And it's only just beginning.
