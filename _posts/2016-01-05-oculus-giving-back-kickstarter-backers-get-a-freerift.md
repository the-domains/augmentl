# Oculus Just Pulled the Ultimate Classy Move

"A small token of appreciation" sets a new precedent in Kickstarter history.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 5th 2016\.

In what is sure to set a historic precedent in good Kickstarter behaviour (outclassing even CastAR's recent [classy move][1]), Oculus have announced that they will be giving away a free [Kickstarter Edition Rift][2] to every single backer of their original 2011 Kickstarter campaign. 

In a project update that no doubt came as a late Christmas surprise to all its recipients, Oculus stated that

Kickstarter backers will be able to claim their free Rift following tomorrow's opening of pre-orders for the device. 

This is an amazing move by Oculus, not just a great PR win and also a (hopefully) final nail in the coffin for the argument that by joining Facebook,  Oculus  had somehow sold out its grassroots community.

If you're a Kickstarter backer, congratulations. For the rest of us, we will still be able to pre-order the Rift following tomorrow's CES announcement.
