# AR Manufacturer Meta Being Accused of Stealing Designs

Bold claims are being made against Meta by someone claiming to represent PhaseSpace Motion Capture. Did Meta's AR glasses design breach an NDA?

by Augmentl, February 21st 2016

Someone claiming to represent a company called PhaseSpace Motion Capture has accused AR manufacturer Meta of breaching an NDA and stealing the design for their AR Head Mounted Display.

The accusation was, somewhat unusually, made in a Facebook [comment][0] linked to [an article][1] covering Meta's recent unveiling at TED of their latest AR development kit. The comment appears to have been posted by PhaseSpace Motion Capture's official Facebook account. 
> 
> "The Design was done by PhaseSpace MotionCapture and has up to 110 degree FOV with 75 degree horizontal and 45 degree vertical. It uses a beam splitter designed for the US Navy. Meta does not have permission to use the design and is violating a NDA." - PhaseSpace Motion Capture

The comment was followed by a promise to showcase the original design that Meta supposedly appropriated at an [SVFR event][2] in San Francisco, but since the event took place yesterday we have so far been unable to track down news or discussions of any such demonstration. 
> 
> "We will be showing the technology that Meta has stolen at SFVR tomorrow in San Francisco for anyone who's already signed up." - PhaseSpace Motion Capture

PhaseSpace was indeed present at the event, but ostensibly only to demo a motion capture technology for VR and multiplayer GearVR experiences.

PhaseSpace Motion Capture went further to describe some of the specifications of the supposed stolen design, a detail which Meta themselves have so far kept under wraps:

> "The design that they stole this from has an FOV that can be 110 for both eyes or 75 x 45" - PhaseSpace Motion Capture

There is currently no evidence to support PhaseSpace's accusations, and the method and venue of said accusations raise some questions as to their seriousness. If Indeed Meta did breach an NDA as PhaseSpace claim, the company could be in no small amount of legal trouble - and a potential lawsuit could threaten the company's thus far successful funding run.

Conversely, by making their accusations public PhaseSpace Motion Capture have put themselves in a precarious legal position - they may now be forced to provide evidence of their claims, or risk more than just their reputation.

We will update this story as and if it develops.
