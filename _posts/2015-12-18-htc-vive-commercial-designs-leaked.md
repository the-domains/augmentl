# HTC Vive Design Leaks Shows Sleeker Looks, Better Ergonomics

As the [HTC Vive Unbound][0] event in Beijing unfolds, a number of keen-eyed Reddit sleuths have started poking around the HTC Website, and finding some delicious images hiding just behind the scenes.

What appear to be renders for both the device's controllers and the main headset have been liberated from the site, showing a substantially more refined version of HTC's first developer kit. 

The controllers in particular have lost their hexagonal pads in favour of circular protrusions with their Lighthouse sensors hidden behind flush, IR-transparent plastics, similar to those used on the Oculus Rift DK2\. The  positional relationship between the touch pad and the trigger seems to also have been adjusted, likely to improve the ergonomics over the previous iteration's somewhat high-placed trigger. It's not clear from the leaked images whether the controllers' shape will let users easily differentiate left from right by touch alone.

The Vive headset itself  also appears to have received an aesthetic clean up, with the same flush sensors as used in the controllers. A front-facing camera, long-speculated to be  used for obstacle (or pet) avoidance, is also somewhat more more prominent.

Although it's not immediately clear from the images available, it also looks like the Vive's top and back straps have been substantially improved with a thicker, more solid construction and what appears to be a padding later inside a thin rigid exterior plastic shell. 

Overall the new HTC Vive design maintains a starkly different look from the Oculus Rift CV1's minimally textured, textile construction, and we can expect some significant ergonomic improvements over the already light, relatively comfortable Vive developer kit.

The HTC Vive is still scheduled for pre-orders in February '16, with consumer availability in April. For developers looking to get their hands on one of the remaining 7000 developer kits, a sign-up form to indicate interest for the kit seems to also have appeared on the [HTC developer site][1].
