# Palmer Luckey on Touch Room-Scale Tracking: "The issue is already put to bed"

The Oculus VR founder made an unexpected appearance on Reddit to issue the final word on a burning question: Can the Rift's Touch controllers work at room-scale?

by [Augmentl][0], 5th February 2016

Following what appears to be a controversial set of discussions on Reddit's popular [/r/Oculus][1] community, Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey made a surprise appearance, confirming once and for all that the Rift and, more specifically, its upcoming Touch motion controllers, will have room-scale tracking capabilities comparable to the HTC Vive's.

This should not be news to anyone familiar with both technologies: while the Rift and the Vive use different tracking methods, both make use of line-of sight between controllers and fixed tracking points (The Rift using IR cameras, the Vive using laser-emitting base stations) to triangulate the controllers' movements in 3D with sub-millimetre precision.

Some doubt as to the two competing VR solutions' respective tracking capabilities remained however due to Oculus' focus on standing, front-facing experiences, while the HTC Vive made headlines with a focus on walk-around, room-scale experiences. With Oculus pre-orders in full swing, and the Vive pre-orders opening on the 29th of this month, the focus on each system's projected controller tracking capabilities had become a hotly debated area amongst enthusiast cicles.

Rather than being due to any specific technical limitations however, the difference in approach between the two companies has more to do with marketing and developer priorities: Oculus simply did not believe the average consumer would benefit from room-scale setups, and chose therefore not to emphasise them in their demos, focusing instead on more traditional front-facing experiences.

Here is Palmer's (somewhat frustrated) statement in full:

> I posted pictures of this setup working, other developers have posted pictures of theirs. Many people, including members of the press, have published articles about pushing the limits of our tracking system. The issue is already put to bed, unless you think there is a concerted effort by myself and others to lie about our technology. 

> You don't see hundred of videos of it because opposed sensors is an alternate configuration for a piece of hardware that is not even available for pre-order and will not ship for months. You also don't see it because the majority of developers are not focusing on that configuration - there is a lot more in the pipeline for offset sensors than opposed sensors. That is obviously not the case for other systems that promote opposed sensors by default, and the vast majority of coverage for any device will revolve around the default configuration. 

> For Rift, the default configuration is currently a single sensor and a gamepad.
> I have higher pre-Rift launch priorities than capturing, editing, and releasing a video that will inevitably be over-analyzed and mis-referenced like the last time I talked about this. If someone doesn't believe me without full length exhaustive "proof", they probably won't believe me after it, either.
