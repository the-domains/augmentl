# **Will Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 820 be a boost to mobile VR?**

In an [article][0] at theinquirer.net, the specifications for Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 820 processor are laid bare. But deep inside the spec sheet the reader will find an interesting, and unprecedented, focus on VR - an area which Qualcomm has somewhat more privately addressed in the past with their behind-the-scenes collaboration with Oculus and Samsung in optimising the GearVR.

Some highlights from Adam Kerin, Qualcomm's senior marketing manager:

> "The Snapdragon 820 is at the forefront of all the areas essential in delivering that feeling of true immersion"

> "If you ever needed the mobile 4K Ultra HD resolution made possible by the Snapdragon 820, VR is the reason. But it's not only about the number of pixels, it's also about the quality of those pixels, and that's where the Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU steps in."

Kerin adds that the new GPU architecture on the Snapdragon 820 offers high enough frame rates and smooth experiences so that users wanting to experience VR on their Snapdragon-powered mobile devices can do so without lag. This, in part, is helped by the firm's Spectra ISP, which supports the speed and performance necessary for "computer vision experiences".

> "The final key component to true immersion in VR is the way in which you interact with the world... When you look around, does your view change in the way you would expect?... This is where the speed and efficiency of the major Snapdragon 820 technologies come together."

The sensor processing used in the Snapdragon 820's brand new Hexagon 680 DSP and the visual rendering of the Adreno 530 GPU work together to make this happen, "nearly instantaneously", so that users genuinely feel as though they are looking around within a 3D world.
