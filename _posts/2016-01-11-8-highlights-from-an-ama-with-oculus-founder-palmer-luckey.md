# 8 Highlights From an AMA With Oculus Founder Palmer Luckey

From Rift production issues to the future of the Oculus Store, here are some key highlights from yesterday's Reddit AMA. 

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 11 2016\.

Oculus Founder Palmer Luckey spent some time yesterday answering questions over on Reddit's [/r/PCMasterRace][1], letting the community of PC enthusiasts and VR enthusiasts alike have answers to some of their most burning questions about the launch of the world' first PC VR solution. These are the highlights.

**On the Rift's production:** reaffirming his previously stated surprise at the amount of demand for the Rift's preorders, Palmer confirmed that Oculus is in the process of scaling up production to meed the unexpected demand. It is unlikely however this will significantly affect shipping estimates, with new preorders for the Rift currently estimated for a June shipping timeframe.

**On the Oculus Store:** Palmer tried to allay fears of a split in the VR market as a result of exclusive storefronts for VR content. According to him the Oculus Store,  Oculus's upcoming curated marketplace for VR content, will not be exclusive to Rift titles and instead accept content that is also compatible with third party VR solutions like the HTC Vive. We'd previously written about the potential for VR to [escape the exclusivity trap][2] that has ensnared multiple generations of consoles, and this is a very positive development at such an early stage for the VR industry. 

Other details on the Oculus store either confirmed or announced by Palmer included the fact that the store will feature interactive, 360ยบ 3D screenshots from inside featured VR experiences, as well as a comfort rating system to help users make more informed decisions as to the content they download. 

**On censorship:** Palmer was asked about Oculus's position towards content censorship, with a particular focus on adult content for the Rift. He restated Oculus's position that, while the Oculus Store will not be featuring adult content, Oculus will do nothing to block such content from third party sources. This will certainly come as welcome news to the burgeoning adult VR industry, which is (somewhat typically) already one of the first to be [actively profiting][3] from VR even before wide consumer adoption.

**On launch content:** it had already been widely reported that the Oculus launch titles would include Eve: Valkyrie and Lucky's Tale, as well as the VR movie experience Henry and another unannounced title from Oculus Studios. Yesterday Palmer also confirmed that the popular Oculus Cinema app for GearVR, which allows standard video content to be experienced in a virtual cinema, will be available for the Rift at launch. Palmer also confirmed that the Rift will come with a "Demo experience" showcasing multiple types of VR experiences in one demonstration reel.

**On the Oculus Touch:** Palmer confirmed once again that the Oculus touch controllers, due later in the year, will include a second tracking camera. He also stated however that consumers will be able to purchase additional tracking cameras separately, opening up more possibilities for the sort of large, room-scale VR scenarios that have thus far been a focus of the HTC Vive. Additional sensors will plug seamlessly into the experience and will be transparent to developers.

**On the Rift's display: **Palmer stated that the Oculus Rift's custom VR displays are so accurate in their colour reproduction that they rival professional desktop displays: _"Our OLED displays and control over the viewing environment make it one of the most accurate displays you can get. In the near future, VR displays are going to surpass traditional displays in almost every way." _

**On Computer Vision:** in recent years Oculus has acquired a number of key players in the computer vision space, including hand-tracking experts NimbleVR and Pebbles Interfaces, as well as Surreal Vision and 13th Lab. We have yet to see any of their output since being acquired by Oculus, but Palmer confirmed that work in the space is proceeding apace: _"all of these teams are working on things that are better than anything you have seen yet."_

The first Oculus Rift headsets are due to reach consumer hands shortly after initial shipping on March 28th. We can expect Oculus to make further announcements about launch content and Oculus touch availability between now and then. 

Until then, come and share your views with us on twitter at [@augmentl][0].
