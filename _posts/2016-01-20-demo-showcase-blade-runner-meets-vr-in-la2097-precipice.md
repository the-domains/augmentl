# Demo Showcase: Blade Runner Meets VR in L.A.2097: Precipice

Stand on Deckard's balcony on a rainy night with this artful, Blade Runner inspired Virtual Reality demo by first-time VR developer zx81

by [Augmentl][0], January 20 2016\.

The rain falls relentlessly between the towering skyscrapers. Traffic noises can be heard over the storm.  You're standing on a balcony, in the dark, the room behind you cloaked in in darkness. You lean over. Just a bit. A sense of vertigo hits you as you look down at the flying cars below.

If you, like me, are a fan of the sci-fi classic Blade Runner, you'll appreciate the artful rendition of the movie's essential atmosphere in this simple, gorgeously visualized demo. 

L.A.2097:Precipice does a lot of things right. It showcases how effective non-photo realistic graphics can be in VR, opting instead to render its environment in a cross between cell-shading and an oil painting. The demo also makes great use of audio, combining rain and traffic sounds to create a believable ambiance in tune with the visuals. And finally, the demo requires absolutely no interaction, freeing the player to simply enjoy the experience.

That combination of factors works to induce as much a sense of presence as I have experienced in the Oculus DK2, which considering the device's limitations should  speak volumes. The demo's performance on a 780Ti was also flawless, and I expect it should run just as well on more modest hardware.

Experienced in a standing position, with some good quality headphones on, L.A.2097 even succeeded in making me feel a twinge of vertigo as I leaned, slowly, over the balcony. All I was missing for the full Deckard experience was a glass of good whiskey and some Vangelis playing in the background.

You can download the latest version of the demo [here][1] or over at [WEARVR][2].
