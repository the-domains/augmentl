    description: "https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/n-plus-plus-ps4/ It's finally here! N++ is now available on PlayStation4. http://www.nplusplus.org In this fast-paced, action-packed puzzle platformer set in the distant 2D future, you play as a ninja -- darting through obstacles, narrowly evading a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots, and collecting gold in a minimalist, sci-fi world."
