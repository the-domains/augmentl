# We called it first: HTC Vive "breakthrough" is indeed improved optics

When we first heard of it, we made some informed predictions about HTC's rumoured 'breakthrough' for the Vive VR headset. How did we do? Turns out, not bad at all.

by Augmentl ([@augmentl][0]), January 5th 2016\.

When HTC first teased their _"very big breakthrough" _a few weeks ago, we decided to try and read between the lines to figure out what this breakthrough could possibly be. We [presented some options][1], and concluded that all things being equal our money would be on a combination of optics and display improvements. How did we do?  Let's see:

**Guess one: Logic board and camera improvements. ** Close but no cigar. While the HTC Vive DK2 has undoubtedly seen its front-facing camera put to use to improve Chaperone, it was nowhere near the level of sophistication we predicted: Instead of using SLAM to m ap a room, the new camera simply overlays a ghost image of the real world onto the VR view. Oh well. 

**Guess two: Improved controllers.** Spot on! We'd dismissed major improvements to controllers as unlikely, and the new controllers merely received upgrades for better ergonomics and a 4 hour battery life. Not bad, but not revolutionary.

**Guess three: Better display (Maybe HDR)**. Half right. We predicted a better display, with the unlikely outside change of HDR being implemented. The new dev kit's screen is indeed brighter if not quite HDR.

**Guess four: Improved Optics:** Spot on! The new optics work closely with the new screen to improve overall visual fidelity and reduce Mura artifacts.

**Our conclusion and best guess: Improved optics.** Oh yes. We'll let the folks at Tom's Hardware report, from their [hands-on][2] with the Vive DK2:

> HTC implemented what it called Mura correction, a way to improve the clarity of the HMD displays. Valve exec Chet Faliszek was unwilling to talk about exactly how Mura correction worked in a conversation with Tom's Hardware, other than to say that it involved every aspect of the display system, nor would he address whether the technology had any impact on system latency... HTC and Valve called this a "breakthrough" that others have tried with prototype add-on filters, but this is the first time -- according to the companies -- that it's been building into a working HMD.

So there you have it. overall not a bad result. You'll excuse us if we go pat ourselves on the back now.
