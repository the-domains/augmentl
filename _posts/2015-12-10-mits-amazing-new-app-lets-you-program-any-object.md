description: "The end goal of the Internet of Things is to make every object in your life programmable. But our smart objects are still pretty dumb. They don't talk to each other, and most are only capable of doing one thing; a smart lightbulb for instance can dim and brighten but it can't tell your TV to change the channel for you."
