already came very close to alienating its fledgling and enthusiastic community by suddenly delaying the release of the HTC Vive virtual reality headset until April 2016, stack the deck even further against themselves by attributing the delay to a 'very big breakthrough?'</p><p>by Augmentl  (<a data-grid-id="e4205a94-c983-441b-909f-ff7b108967d3" href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">@augmentl</a>), December 21st 2015.</p><p>Talk of breakthroughs in the high-tech industry is always dangerous: it ignites ceaseless speculation, which in turn raises expectations, which devolve into hype, which almost always overshadows the actual technical advancement. Anything that falls into a hype cycle therefore almost always results in disappointment.</p><p>So from a PR perspective, HTC's recent claim of a delayed release date due to <a data-grid-id="3b2e648b-3a6f-410e-aaf1-e7928eccbe5d" href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/htc-vive-vr-big-breakthrough-ces/">'very big breakthrough'</a>  is all downside. Especially so since, after threatening to beat VR incumbents Oculus to market for almost a year, HTC's recently announced delay in their own release date for the Vive had already put Oculus back in the potential driver's seat despite the latter's still vague release timeframe of "sometime in Q1 2016." </p><p>A cynical mind would therefore be tempted to speculate that HTC's talk of a breakthrough may simply be aimed at getting its community to hold off on an eventual Oculus pre-order (still loosely expected to be announced in the few days left in 2015) until finding out more about what HTC has up its sleeve.</p><p>But there's a big problem with that strategy: HTC has also promised to reveal their breakthrough at CES 2016, a mere <a data-grid-id="ce43cbb7-24bb-4054-8ec2-898b0d22cecc" href="https://www.cesweb.org/">few weeks away</a>. So any time bought by keeping the community guessing until then would be inconsequential should Oculus finally announce a release before April 2016.</p><p>Setting aside, therefore, the unlikely possibility that HTC are just desperately buying time, we're left in the position of having to seriously consider that HTC and Valve may indeed be onto something. As far as what that "something" actually is however, all we know for sure is this:</p><ul><li>It was first demonstrated by Valve three weeks ago</li><li><p data-grid-id="ef13bb22-72a5-4e28-949a-1af57ea78746">It is not featured by any of the HTC Vive's competitors (or it wouldn't quality as a breakthrough)</p></li><li><p data-grid-id="dcfb23a7-df3d-4a6d-841c-254213db6d30">It's of sufficient impact to the end-user experience for HTC to delay the Vive to ensure it was implemented</p></li><li><p data-grid-id="98dee7b9-f2c2-4128-91a6-84217457a26f">It cannot simply be deployed as a software or firmware patch.</p></li><li><p data-grid-id="57433c98-a6ed-42d3-966d-cbb8007efd50">Most importantly, its implementation complexity (or lack thereof) is such that it can be inserted into HTC's manufacturing process merely four months ahead of an April 2016 release</p></li></ul><p>So what is so big that it warrants a delay, yet so small that it can be seamlessly be worked into a manufacturing process within a few months of release? There are a two obvious categories that fit the bill:</p><p><b data-grid-id="dbafed7c-1433-4ce4-a3c9-ca9875fa3a64">Logic board, camera improvements: </b>HTC and Valve could have devised improvements to the HTC Vive's internal logic board that allow for new functionality to be implemented. A good example of this would be shortening the internal latency between the device's front-facing camera and its IMU, allowing for more accurate frame timings to be tied to head movements. Such a system would facilitate SLAM implementations from inside-out positional tracking (not required of the Vive as it already has Lighthouse) to <a data-grid-id="6ecb3f66-f11b-4a3c-99fb-9998a35739c0" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_GD7kUbogk">photogrammetry</a>. </p><p>The latter, if properly implemented, would allow the <a data-grid-id="5d32f42a-7663-497e-9359-a853e267654a" href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/valve-trademarks-something-called-chaperone-related-to-vr">chaperone</a> system allowing it to "scan" the surrounding environment right down to the furniture, enabling Augmented Reality use cases as well as more accurate collision avoidance. While this would certainly be interesting, it's not the kind of primary use case that would warrant delaying the release date but rather a 2.0, roadmap feature (Although, incidentally, scanning real-world objects was in fact a use case included in the original chaperone <a data-grid-id="11a8fd6b-1870-4bb2-a977-d243bc70fae9" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-20-what-is-valves-chaperone">trademark</a> application).</p><p><b data-grid-id="dd808d60-e2c4-447b-8e39-bdf207fd563c">A direct component replacement:</b> HTC and Valve may have come up with a replacement to an existing component that improves the user experience to such an extent that it can warrant being called a breakthrough, and because it's a replacement to an existing part it can be deployed without disrupting the manufacturing process. The most viable component candidates in terms of impact to the user experience are, in order of impact are Screen, optics, and controllers. </p><p>Screen innovations of sufficient user impact are limited to resolution and gamut. Resolution would require a higher base spec for the host PC and would not really qualify as a breakthrough. But a <a data-grid-id="e73e1dcd-4c97-4486-a68a-6977c1f4595f" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11340226/Netflix-HDR-is-more-important-than-4K.html">HDR screen</a>? That would certainly qualify, but would also require the host PC to support the <a data-grid-id="f7c892da-6931-4f72-aebe-81d46326dabb" href="http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_2_0/hdmi_2_0a_faq.aspx">HDMI 2.0a</a> standard, limiting the number of users who'd be able to take advantage of it to only those with the latest and greatest hardware.  </p><p>Controller innovations could include haptic feedback or higher precision tracking, but neither could reasonably be considered a breakthrough in an of itself. Combined with the general novelty of VR control systems, this would suggest that controllers are an unlikely candidates for this breakthrough. </p><p>Optics are therefore a much more likely candidate. An improved lens and/or diffuser layer configuration could conceivably achieve a greater perceived resolution and/or improve the HTC Vive's Field of View. Most importantly, both optics and the screen diffuser layer (which is used to reduct the visibility of gaps between the screen's pixels) are components that could feasibly be swapped within the manufacturing process without too much fuss, as they involve no electronics.</p><p>Improved optics are prime candidates for high-impact, low-complexity manufacturing improvements for the HTC Vive. We've already seen examples of alternative optics approaches from <a data-grid-id="2334275f-afeb-48ce-83d4-198622fe0934" href="http://www.wearality.com/">Wearality</a> (wide FoV Fresnel lenses) and <a data-grid-id="7b1006e9-630d-45ab-82be-ad4a1c75f56d" href="http://www.razerzone.com/osvr-hacker-dev-kit">OSVR</a> (Dual optics modules for minimal distortion), and while it's debatable whether a refined optical solution alone would truly qualify as a "breakthrough" for the HTC Vive, it may just about pass muster if the impact to the end user is sufficiently stark. </p><p>A much less likely candidate is a move to a HDR screen, which while undoubtedly qualifying as a breakthrough would also bump the minimum spec of the system above that of Oculus's own solution, not to mention the unlikely availability of suitable screens for mass manufacturing.</p><p>We'll have to wait until CES 2016's HTC Vive reveal to see whether this is indeed the case, and until some time after that to find out whether HTC's gamble has paid off.
