release of both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, is VR at risk of repeating the decades-old cycle of content exclusivity, or will it succeed where consoles failed? </p><p>by Augmentl (<a data-grid-id="575049e3-b1bb-450e-a355-9716bda91ad7" href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">@augmentl</a>). Nov 25, 2015.</p><p>The time of consumer VR hardware is imminent. According to all the latest official information (and not a small quantity of rumours), HTC and Oculus are about to drop their respective VR bombs on an enthusiastic, expectant horde of PC gamers and early adopters - including yours truly. Sometime later, the Sony PlayStation's own VR peripheral is expected to hit the market, with speculation already rampant that it may quickly become the <a data-grid-id="4068ca42-c74e-4d14-a802-baf3de449a85" href="http://vrfocus.com/archives/25575/ps4s-impressive-sales-data-gives-playstation-vr-a-30-million-headstart/">dominant VR platform</a> by sheer number of users.</p><p>Historically, when a new entertainment platform needed to elbow its way into the market, it relied on a juicy selection of exclusive features and titles to differentiate itself from the competition. The Xbox had Gears of War. The Playstation had the Uncharted series. The Wii had... Well, some gimmicky control system whose novelty and success burned bright yet brief. Whether hardware or software, exclusivity mattered.</p><p>At first glance, the advent of consumer VR is showing some indication of following that same tried and true formula. The PlayStationVR is likely to come out swinging with its own <a data-grid-id="f7c93f61-12f4-4783-aebe-1e9b47f5be7f" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsVeBjtWgmo">typically Japanese</a> experience, as well as a promising list of more broadly appealing <a data-grid-id="ece61c95-f864-4a29-856c-69bd3eb58c88" href="http://www.alphr.com/sony/1000343/playstation-vr-release-date-specs-and-must-have-games-see-every-playstation-vr-game/page/0/3">roster of titles</a>. The HTC Vive will of course come out with the might of the Steam digital distribution platform behind it, and will most likely not be wanting for first and third party titles. OculusVR has gone as far as creating their own in-house movie and game studio to supply the Rift with top-notch first-party content.</p><p>There may however be some encouraging signs that VR could break the age old cycle of content exclusivity. So far, the number of new and upcoming VR titles announced with cross-platform support far outweighs the number of exclusives. Titles like Oculus's own Henry, Lucky's Tale, and Sony Online Entertainment's Summer Lesson actually stand out as a tiny minority of all the upcoming VR titles announced thus far. Which is an unqualified Good Thing.</p><p>Some of this lack of exclusivity, at least in the case of the two PC-based VR solutions, can be attributed to OculusVR's and Valve's shared history when it comes to the development of these first VR devices. The two companies' open and enthusiastic cross-pollination of ideas and technical solutions was in fact one of the key drivers to VR's relatively <a href="http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/250870/The-design-iterations-of-the-Oculus-Rift/#vars!date=2013-03-28_08:26:30!">rapid evolution</a> from a duct-tape prototype to its imminent consumer form.</p><p>Much can also be attributed to the early support of dominant game engines like <a data-grid-id="e0344834-96b8-411f-83ff-c1f868880497" href="https://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform/vr-ar">Unity</a> and <a data-grid-id="47722a30-2ab9-463b-a2e1-3ba4de5f541f" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/vr-page">Unreal 4</a> for the Oculus SDK, SteamVR SDK and the PlayStationVR, a move that has allowed game developers to broadly focus on getting their content to fundamentally work in VR (not a trivial challenge at this point in the game), instead of focusing on the differences between the three platforms. This cross-platform compatibility on the part of these game engines can in turn be partly attributed to the fact that the display characteristics of HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift are, <i data-grid-id="7b426ee4-e486-4578-a1c4-ea42674efaca">for the most part</i>, <a data-grid-id="c03c0745-46e1-482f-8e6e-7ce4cd0f3b82" href="http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/htc-vive-vs-oculus-rift-1301375">virtually identical</a>. </p><p>But there may be something else at play. Despite its runaway success in terms of investment over the past two years - in both raw dollars and in terms of development interest - VR is still largely unproven as a consumer proposition. Sure, it will undoubtedly be a huge hit with enthusiasts and early adopters, but whether it will reach a critical mass of users to become an established platform in its own right is still to be seen. It is therefore in everyone's interest to push VR forward together, and avoid putting off consumers from the get-go by forcing them to select their hardware of choice based on the promise of exclusive content.</p><p>So it seems that we're off to a good start. But as we all hold hands, sing Kumbaya and cheerily walk into our bright VR future, we should keep a wary eye on past mistakes. At some point soon, if successful, Virtual Reality will reach that elusive critical mass. More hardware players will enter the scene, steadily moving VR from the status of an early-adopter, premium experience to an increasingly commoditised technology with predictably shrinking margins. </p><p>It's at that point that things could get ugly: since it's generally cheaper to collar a small number of good pet studios than to radically innovate hardware, the temptation for rival platforms to differentiate via software exclusives might raise its ugly head. Suddenly, forcing consumers to choose your VR headset if they want to play their favourite game franchise might seem like a good idea. So is there anything we can do to prevent that outcome?</p><p>For the most part, developers and consumers will both need to learn to say no. It's still early enough in the VR game that positions and principles can be staked and established, and a policy of openness promoted at the grass-roots level. More so than ever, in fact, when we consider the massive impact that small indie developers are already having on the initial, platform-defining crop of titles that will be soon available across these first VR platforms. </p><p>Unlike with the last three generations of consoles, the most innovative and genre-defining VR content is currently being almost completely driven by independent developers. These same developers therefore will soon find themselves in the unusual position of being able to influence, if not outright dictate, how the VR market will be shaped. If anyone can keep the VR software market free of arbitrary exclusivity constraints, it's them.</p><p>Let's hope they do.</p><p><a data-grid-id="e8d4108c-ed1f-4028-8e58-dbfda6663f11" href="http://twitter.com/augmentl">@augmentl</a></p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="59"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="61"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="62"><span data-reactid="63"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="64"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a1bbe8e-ef4f-4c29-afdb-4cf9a08647c4.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="65"/></a><h2 data-reactid="66"><a data-reactid="67">ɅUGMΞNTL.IO</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="69"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="70"><div class="Link" data-reactid="71"><a data-reactid="72">Augmentl</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="73"></div></section></div></div>
